Used XSLT to convert XML metrics to YAML format.  It is also somewhat easier
than doing it in Java.  But I'm toying with the idea of keeping both
implementations.  There were some interesting uses of the Stream API in those
=Printer= subclasses.  But I still need to fix how =JSONPrinter= deals with
commas in lists.

I re-wrote the =JSONPrinter= to capitalize on =Collections.joining()=.  It
clones itself to render sub-parts.  It will end up using more memory as it
writes sub-parts using =java.io.StringWriter= and only writes them out at the
very end.
