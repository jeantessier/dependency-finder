Used XSLT to convert XML metrics to YAML format.  It is also somewhat easier
than doing it in Java.  But I'm toying with the idea of keeping both
implementations.  There were some interesting uses of the Stream API in those
=Printer= subclasses.  But I still need to fix how =JSONPrinter= deals with
commas in lists.
