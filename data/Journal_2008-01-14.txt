Ran Dependency Finder through [[http://findbugs.sf.net][FindBugs]] and found a
few quick fixes, including one clear bug in
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.cli.ListDiff= where I was not closing a stream
when reading in a file.  Twice.  And two constants in =TransitiveClosure= that
were not marked =final=.  But there were quite a few false positives too.
