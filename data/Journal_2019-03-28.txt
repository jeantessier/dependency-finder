A user pointed out a problem analyzing some JAXB files.  Once again, the files
contain new constant pool entries for Java 9.  They proposed a patch to ignore
a specific filename, but I think it's better to catch the Exception, log it, and
continue extracting the class information.  Now, there is a small risk that
=.class= files will be skipped "silently".  Users could find out by scrutinizing
the output with =-verbose=, or with clever Log4J settings, but it's more likely
they won't realize they only have partial data.

I will need to update the =com.jeantessier.classreader= package to the latest
bytecode.
