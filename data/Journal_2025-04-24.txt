Big bug: =JarJarDiff= can be non-deterministic under certain conditions.  I was
generating differences between version =1.4.1.1= and the latest code, and the
results kept changing from one call to the next.  For example, =Classfile=
could have anywhere between 1 and 6 differences, even though I was analyzing
the very same files.  I ran the same comparison 10 times and compared the
results.  A few methods kept coming in and out of the report.

    * =getConstantPool()=
    * =getField()=
    * =getInterface()=
    * =getMethod()=
    * =getRawClass()=
    * =getRawSuperclass()=

These methods have one thing in common: the latest version of =Classfile= has
two methods for each signature: one explicit method and one synthetic bridge
method.

In =DifferencesFactory=, when analyzing a class, we collect unique signatures
from the old and new versions.  If a method is a synthetic variation, it gets
treated as one with the explicit method.  The factory uses
=Classfile.getMethod()= to get the old and new =Method_info= that represent the
method.  But =getMethod()= uses a stream with =findAny()=, whose documentation
says: "The behavior of this operation is explicitly nondeterministic."
Sometimes, it might return the explicit method, and at other times, it might
return the corresponding synthetic method.

I will need to revise how =DifferencesFactory= selects =Method_info= instances
when looking for differences between methods.
