Found another example of an annotation that takes array and class values even
closer to home in =org.junit.Test= and =org.junit.runners.Suite.SuiteClasses=.
And even better, =TestAll= has both of these, so all I need to do to find an
example is analyze =TestAll=.

I did a quick spike to try to track annotations as part of
=com.jeantessier.classreader.MetricsGatherer=.  Early results are promising,
but this was just a spike so I will have to throw away that code and redo it
properly, test-first.
