Reorganized =build.xml= into a number of build file.  This way, someone can
compile Dependency Finder with a minimum of third-party libraries, namely
the Servlets API and WebWork, instead of needing all the libraries used for
testing like Fit and HttpUnit.

I should get rid of the CVS report tasks eventually, now that everything is in
Subversion.  I don't know if I will create equivalent reports like Subversion,
given that SourceForge already has some statistics on source control.
