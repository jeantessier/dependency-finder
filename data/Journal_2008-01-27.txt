Played a little bit with JUnit 4.4.  It is perfectly backwards compatible, so
I could just upgrade to it and keep on writing tests like with the 3.8.2
version.  The are moving to a new syntax that uses
[[http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/][Hamcrest]] =Matcher= classes, like jMock
so you can write assertions like =assertThat(actualValue, is(expectedValue))=.
While it makes the code closer to English, it also makes it farther from Java.
I'm not totally convinced this is a good thing.  It is more expressive, that's
for sure.  What I would really like to see is an automated way to build test
suites, without me having to hard-code which tests are in a given suite.  I
haven't found the mechanism to do this in JUnit 4.
