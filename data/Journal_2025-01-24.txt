Created a
[[https://hub.docker.com/r/jeantessier/dependency-finder-micronaut][Docker image]]
to run Dependency Finder Micronaut app and React frontend in a Docker
container.

I built the
[[https://github.com/jeantessier/dependencyfinder-react-app][React app]] and
dropped it in the
[[https://github.com/jeantessier/micronaut-depfind-test][Micronaut app]]'s
=src/main/resources/static/frontend/= folder.  This way, it is included when
the Micronaut app gets deployed.  If I run it in a Docker container and export
port =8080=, my browser can download the React app from =http://localhost:8080=
and it can contact the microservice back at =http://localhost:8080=.

I created a tunnel to my app running locally using
=[[https://ngrok.com/][ngrok]]=.  I could download the React app from another
computer, through the =ngrok= tunnel, but it still believed it was being hosted
at =localhost=, so it couldn't connect back to the microservice to load any
data.

I also tried to deploy the Micronaut Docker image using GitHub actions, but I
couldn't get the workflow quite right.  In Micronaut, interactions with Docker
are mediated through Gradle.  I will need to explore how to make it work with
the GitHub actions for Docker.  Or, maybe I just use a bunch of shell commands
instead of a third-party GitHub action.
