Fixed the deep links into the Tools page (and Manual and Developer too).  The
previous version was very simpleminded.  Each heading became a top-level
anchor; duplicates were dealt with by appending =X=s to them.  The new links
are hierarchical, building on higher headings and joining them using =%5F=.
The link to =OOMetrics -version= went from =#-versionXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX= to
=#ToolsinDependencyFinder%5FOOMetrics%5FSwitches%5F-version=.

One day, I would like to turn the switches in the various synopses into links
to each switch's description.
