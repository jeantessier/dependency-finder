Moved the remaining =build.test.xml= logic to =build.xml=.  Moved the last bits
of =tests/JarJarDiff= to the =:integration-tests:jarjardiff= subproject.
Cleaned up tests and their imports.

Removed source and =*.bz2= distribution archives.  The sources are
automatically available via GitHub; it even puts them as release files without
having to ask for it.

Skipped all =:webapp= tests.  I had to convert them to JUnit 4 so I could use
=@Ignore= to skip them.  Now, I can just type =./gradle check= and it runs all
tests across all subprojects (and skips the HttpUnit tests).
