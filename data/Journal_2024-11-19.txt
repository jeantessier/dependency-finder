Finished reformating the =/query= page of my React app using
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids][Grid Layout]].
I was able to get rid of =&lt;blockquote&gt;= tags and replace them by
=&lt;div&gt;= tags with CSS classes.  I used the =ch= unit to re-create the
indentation from =&lt;blockquote&gt;=.
