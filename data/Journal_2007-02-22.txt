I noticed that calling CLI commands with the =-version= switch when the command
has mandatory parameters or switches resulted in an error message and no
version information.  I reorganized the command-line parsing logic so it
collects error messages in a manner that does not prevent processing a
=-version= or a =-help= switch.
