[[https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/the-arrival-of-java-23][Java 23]] is out.
I looked at the
[[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/index.html][JVM specification]], and I
couldn't find any changes to the =.class= file format.  Good.

I tried to add a =getSignatureDeclaration()= method to =Method_info=.  The goal
is to walk up the class hierarchy to locate the declaration of a given method.
I don't really like the name, but I can't think of a better one for now.
