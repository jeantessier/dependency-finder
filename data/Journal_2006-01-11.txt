Played a bit with [[http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/][WebWork]].  I have
been toying with the idea of rewriting the webapp using WebWork, but since it
is merging with Struts now, I'm not so sure anymore.  I don't want the webapp
to bloat just because it needs a whole bunch of infrastructure JARs.  Already,
the default type of WebWork webapp requires 1MB of JARs before you've even
started doing anything.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Tomcat</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>5.5.12</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>5.5.15</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
