Added =com.jeantessier.commandline.TextPrinter= to echo the command-line, as
perceived by a program.  Some recent problems with the CLI stemmed from
improper escaping of shell metacharacters.  I hope that with some kind of
=-echo= switch users will be able to see what values made it into the program.

I had to rework =CommandLineSwitch= so each switch contained its own name.
This gave me the occasion to add unit tests to that package.
