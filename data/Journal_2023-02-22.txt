Came upon [[https://github.com/kordamp/jarviz][Jarviz]] after seeing a
[[https://techhub.social/@shaaf@fosstodon.org/109908135360633134][toot]] about
it on Mastodon and an
[[https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/introducing-jarviz/][article]] on InfoQ.
One interesting use case for Jarviz is finding the version of Java classfiles,
so we can make sure dependencies are compatible.

I looked at adding something similar to =OOMetrics=.  But the current metrics
are assumed to be numbers.  And the set of metrics is fixed by the config,
instead of creating metrics based on the data, like versions "60" and "63".

I  added class-level metrics for "major version" and "minor version".  But I
will need to do more work to aggregate them at the group- or project-level.  I
would like to build a histogram of different major versions in JAR files.  And
maybe go so far as listing out the classes by version number.
