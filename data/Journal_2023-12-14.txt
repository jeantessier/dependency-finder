I merged the migration to Gradle back into the =master= branch.  I verified
that everything works: exec environment, distribution files, WAR file, and the
Docker image.  I still need Ant at the top level to coordinate some last
cross-project dependencies, until I can figure out how to do it from within
Gradle.

Adjusted the Docker instructions to use Gradle instead.

Refreshed the Tutorial on the website.  The old HTML was geared towards
Internet Explorer and no longer works in modern browsers.  I don't have access
to PowerPoint anymore, so I loaded it in Apple's Keynote and saved as HTML
again.  I also added a PDF version.
