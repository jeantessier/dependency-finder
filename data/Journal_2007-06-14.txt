Fixed tests so they could run without a network connection.
=MetricsConfigurationLoader= takes an optional boolean as to whether or not
validate XML documents against their DTD.  When running the tests without a
network connection, you can set the =DF_VALIDATE= environment variable to
anything but the string "true" to set the Java property
=DEPENDENCYFINDER_TESTS_VALIDATE= which in turn controls what gets passed to
=MetricsConfigurationLoader=.  Some new tests that verify the behavior of
=*.XMLPrinter= also try to parse the resulting XML and need to turn off the
validation feature of the parser when the network connection is not available.

Fixed the command-line test launchers to account for the latest versions of
WebWork and Tomcat, which have changed the name and/or location of their JARs.
Note that =junit= and =junit.bat= require that you pass them =-noloading= for
the HttpUnit-based tests to work.  They don't seem to like the classloader that
JUnit uses to reload classes between tests.
