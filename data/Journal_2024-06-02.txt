Refactored =StatisticalMeasurement= to add percentiles.  The statistics that it
exposes are minimum, median, and maximum.  But this does not tell us how far
outliers are from the other results.  For that, it would be helpul to have
values line the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile or the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile.
And maybe even the 1<sup>st</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for the lower
end of the range.  Maybe, once I have a percentile function, I can replace
=getMedian()= with the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile!

I keep thinking of the median as a value from the set.  But looking at the
code, I noticed it was averaging the two central values when the dataset had an
even number of elements.  That is how they
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median#Finite%5Fset%5Fof%5Fnumbers][recommend to do it]]
on Wikipedia, and it is likely where I picked it up.  So I left the
calculation of the median as it was, but with a little bit of clean up to use
the Streams API and inline some trivial methods.

I did add =getPercentile(n)= and I will look for the best way to expose
percentiles in =OOMetrics= reports.  I could use canned percentiles, like
=1=, =10=, =50=, =90=, and =99=, but I'd like to let users decide which
percentiles make sense for them.  Maybe there is a way to specify them in the
configuration, as part of the initialization text for =StatisticalMeasurement=.
