Migrated the Fit tests to a Gradle subproject called =:fit-tests=.  I was able
to "upgrade" =fitlibrary= from =20060116= that I had been using until now to
=20070619=.  The next version up introduces some changes that break my tests.
I think something changed in =DoFixture=, but I cannot find release notes that
would explain how to update my tests.  It's been 16 years, so I'll have to do
some digging.
