More support for annotations.

I've built support for some of the annotation attributes and pretty much all
types of element value.  Now, I need to figure out how to instantiate element
values based on the tag in the byte stream.  Once I have that, I will be able
to finish =ArrayElementValue= and write =ElementValuePair= so I can then
finish =Annotation=.  Then, I will have to rig it all up into
=com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor=.

Added some tests for some structures that were not covered before:

    * =InterfaceMethodRef_info=
    * =Deprecated_attribute=
    * =Synthetic_attribute=
    * =SourceDebugExtension_attribute=

[[http://jmock.org/][jMock]] is really helping create a stage where I can
exercise the classes very easily.
