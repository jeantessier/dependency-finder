Cleaned up straggling =-all= switches in sample code in the documentation.

Fixed some of the tools so they can read from standard input:

    * =c2c=
    * =c2p=
    * =ClassCohesion=
    * =DependencyClosure=
    * =DependencyCycles=
    * =DependencyMetrics=
    * =DependencyReporter=
    * =f2f=
    * =p2p=

This way, I can chain them on a command-line so the output of one becomes the
input of the next one, just like typical Unix tools.

Found a bug with =com.jeantessier.metrics.MetricsGatherer= where it is not
accounting for final classes correctly.  Filed it as
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D2008537&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][bug 2008537]]
Fixed it and added more tests.

While I was testing =MetricsGatherer=, I noticed some measurements are being
gathered both at the project and at the group level separately.  I wanted to
remove the duplication because I could compute the one at the project level
from submetrics at the group level.  This would work as long as groups matched
packages exactly.  But it would breakdown if someone used group specifications
to add groups besides packages.  This is why there is this duplication.
