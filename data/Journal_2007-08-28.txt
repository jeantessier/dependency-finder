Someone was asking for a tool to track public methods that are not used outside
their package.  They could use such a tool to narrow down the exposed interface
of a library.  I started thinking how I could do this using Dependency Finder.
One problem is that most tools don't record the access level of programming
elements.  =JarJarDiff= does it, but it doesn't know about dependencies.
=OOMetrics= keeps a count by access level, but does not keep track of the acces
level of individual methods.  One possibility would be to get a list of public
and protected methods, maybe with =ListSymbols=, and pass them to =OOMetrics=
somehow.  The =-scope-includes-list= switch to =OOMetrics= controls which
dependencies it tracks, not which metrics are reported.  With the
=-show-empty-metrics= switch and a
=&lt;lower-threshold&gt;1&lt;/lower-threshold&gt;= in the
configuration for the =IEPM= measurement, any method without any extra-package
dependency would stand out, but right now that includes private and package
methods.
