Added hyperlinks on scoped node names in =HTMLPrinter= for the web app so the
user can narrow down the scope to a single package, class, or feature.  It is
not perfect, and sometimes behaves in surprising ways, but it is as good (or
bad) as the hyperlink on dependency names.  Note that each link simply forces
the =scope-includes= field to a certain prefix; it does not change the flags
for what is in scope, whether it's packages, classes, and/or features.

Suppose a query result has lots of packages, classes, and features.  You can
click on a class name reduces the scope to elements prefixed with that name.
In the query result, if you click on the package's name, it will expand the
scope of the query back to all elements in the package.

Modified =advancedquery.jsp= so it uses =HTMLPrinter=.  Refactored =TestQuery=
to share tests between =query.jsp= and =advancedquery.jsp=.  I also added tests
that actually follow the hyperlinks to verify they do the right thing.
