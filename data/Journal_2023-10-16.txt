Refactored the =ClassCohesion= CLI tool and wrote documentation for it on the
Tools page.  At the moment, it is only accessible via the CLI.  There is no Ant
task for it.  Refactoring the various =print...()= helper functions was a nice
exercise in combining streams.  Merging two streams was easy enough to do with
=Stream.concat()=.  But merging a stream of XML text with opening and closing
tags was more tricky.

    return Stream.of(
        Stream.of("<tag>"),
        getStreamForContents(contents),
        Stream.of("</tag>")
    )
    .flatMap(Function.identity())
    .collect(joining(System.getProperty("line.separator")));

I have to wrap the opening and closing tags in streams of a single value and
then use =flatMap()= to convert =Stream&lt;Stream&lt;String&gt;&gt;= to a
=Stream&lt;String&gt;=.  The nice thing was building up streams of streams of
streams with a single =joining()= at the very top to collapse them back
together.
