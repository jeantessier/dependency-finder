Switched the Introduction page and the Journal page to
[[https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/][Tufte CSS]].

I have been using Tufte CSS for my
[[https://jeantessier.com/SoftwareEngineering/Journal.html][personal blog]]
for a few years now, and I like the look.  It uses white space intelligently
to help the eye read the text with minimal straining.  I write my blog using
Markdown and a JavaScript library converts it to HTML in the browser.  This
conversion step sometimes interfere with some of the features of Tufte CSS, so
I cannot use it to its full potential.  But the Journal page is rendered HTML
on the server, and I have complete control on it.  I can use features like
sidenotes and figures to their fullest.
