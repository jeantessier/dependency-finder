Wrote an Ant build file for running
[[http://testabilityexplorer.org/][Testability Explorer]] against Dependency
Finder.  I know the guys who work on it and it has some interesting ideas
about testability behind it.  I might start publishing its report along-side
the coverage reports with the next release of Dependency Finder.
