Finished refactoring the CLI commands.  Made some fixed to the tools
documentation in the process.

Adapted the build file for Clover for Clover 1.3 and streamlined the flow to
generate a coverage analysis report.  Emma copies instrumented files to a
separate directory, but I can't seem to get Clover to do the same.  Since some
of the metrics and API difference tests operate on compiled Dependency Finder
classes themselves, the instrumentation throws them off.  But the resulting
code coverage analysis seems close enough just the same.
