Tried to used
[[http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/][Google Collections]] in
=Classfile=.  I was hoping that =Iterables.find()= would simplify methods like
=getField()= and =getMethod()=, even with the added boilerplate for the
anonymous inner class for the =Predicate=.  But =find()= throws an exception
if it doesn't find a match whereas my code has been returning =null=.  Once I
throw in the exception handling, the methods is much harder to read than the
simple =for()= loop I had before.

Google Collections uses the =@Nullable= annotation from
[[http://code.google.com/p/jsr-305/][JSR 305]].  But the project doesn't have
any binaries, so I had to steal the JAR file from the
[[http://code.google.com/p/findbugs/][FindBugs]] project.  It doesn't feel as
clean as I would want it.  Maybe I need to let Google Collections to bake for a
little while longer.
