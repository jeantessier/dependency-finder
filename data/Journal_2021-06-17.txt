Fixed the calculation of =median= values for =StatisticalMeasurement=.  I'd
always believed that the median value of a list had to be a member of that list.
When the list's size is odd, that's easy enough.  But when the list size is
even, I would use the rightmost of the two middle elements.  It turns out that
for lists of numbers, we're supposed to use
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median][the average of the two middle numbers]]
instead.
