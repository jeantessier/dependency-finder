Added code coverage using [[https://www.jacoco.org/index.html][JaCoCo]], a
descendent of [[https://emma.sourceforge.net/][EMMA]].  There is a
[[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco%5Fplugin.html][Gradle plugin]]
for it.  I used a variation with a
_[[https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample%5Fjvm%5Fmulti%5Fproject%5Fwith%5Fcode%5Fcoverage%5Fdistribution.html][standalone utility project]]_
to get transitive dependencies between the various test subprojects and the
=:lib= subproject.  I set up =:integration-tests= and =:fit-tests= as their own
subprojects, so they could encapsulate the test data and fixture classes that
each one needs.  This makes it more complicated for JaCoCo to track coverage of
classes in =:lib= that are exercised by the tests in these subprojects.

It seems the other code coverage tools I had been using in the past, like
[[https://sourceforge.net/projects/cobertura/][Cobertura]],
[[https://cenqua.com/][Clover]], and
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/emma][EMMA]], have fallen behind.

I also refreshed the Samples page to bring it up to date with the latest
versions of Dependency Finder.  It had been over 10 years since the last
update.  For some reason, the layout of the dependency graph page does not work
properly with the latest graphs.  I can't see any difference, and it works just
fine when I point my browser to the local files, or serve them from my laptop
using a local webserver.  But when I load them from SourceForge, everything is
against the left margin.
