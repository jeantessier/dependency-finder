I was reading an
[[https://gist.github.com/SuperCoder7979/c7171b0e34b6eccf0b9f1c37030867dc][article comparing Fernflower and Quiltflower]]
where they showed something in Java called _try-with-resources_.  It's a way to
write =try= blocks where you close a resource in the =finally= clause.  It's
been in Java since Java 7.  I switched all the places where I would close a
resource in a =finally= clause, usually reading files, and replaced them with
the _try-with-resource_ pattern.
