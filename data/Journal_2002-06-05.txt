Created =classfile.dtd= and put it at:

    [[dtd][https://depfind.sourceforge.io/dtd/]]

Added a =TableCellRenderer= to the
=JTable= instances in =OOMetricsGUI=
to draw out-of-bound measurements in red.  I also tried
to set the background to create bands of three rows of
alternating colors, but it is not working perfectly yet.

Added a _new metrics_ tool to =OOMetricsGUI=
to reset the list of measurements.

Measurements in the configuration file can now be made
invisible via an XML attribute on =&lt;measurement&gt;=
tags.

I tried to change the default self-disposition of
=StatisticalMeasurement= to average values, but it
behaved strangely by ignoring itself instead.  Strange!  I
also tried to have separate renderer classes for
=StatisticalMeasurement= and the other subclasses
of =MeasurementBase=, but that also didn't quite
work out.  More on that later ... maybe.
