Refactored =com.jeantessier.text.Hex= to use the Streams API and
=java.util.Formatter= to render bytes in text and XML outputs.  All the
=print()= methods were used for single bytes, so I replaced them with calls to
=Formatter= instead.  That left the =toString()= static method, which I
refactored to use streams to traverse the byte array and write to a =String=.
I used this opportunity to format the bytes with extra spaces that make the
output easier to read.
