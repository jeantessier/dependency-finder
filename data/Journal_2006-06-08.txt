For some reason, I cannot compute closures with the web app anymore.  I will
have to investigate further.  =query.jsp= finds the node I'm interested in and
shows dependencies in and out of it.  =metrics.jsp= also sees it and can
compute measurements about it.  But when I try the same regular expression in
=closure.jsp=, I get an empty result.

There is a problem with =DependencyMetrics=.  The sub-heading under _outbound_
add up to the total for _inbound_ and vice versa.  Sure enough, that's what the
code is computing.  I'll have to study my own code again to figure out what was
the original intent.  Maybe I can write some tests, this time around, to
document what it is supposed to do.
