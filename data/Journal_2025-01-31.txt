Figured out how to use environment variables and
[[https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#propertySource][Docker settings]] to
point the Micronaut service to custom code and dependency graph locations.  The
defaults in `application.properties` are for running the service locally,
outside of Docker.  When running it in a container, I can use environment
variables to point the service to `/code`, like the Dependency Finder webapp,
and then mount volumes at these locations.

I wrote some integration
[[https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-test/latest/guide/][tests for Micronaut]].
I started with =LoadController= and =ExtractController=.  I was able to do
simple GET requests and verify the load and extract metadata.  I could put
test-specific properties using special =.properties= files, but I was not
successful is making POST requests to trigger loading or extracting.

I broke up the single =micronaut.depfind.test= package into:

    * =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.micronaut=
    * =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.micronaut.controllers=
    * =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.micronaut.services=

The whole Micronaut service is still called =micronaut-depfind-test=, but it's
a start.
