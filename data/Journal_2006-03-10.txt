A user was asking questions about =Monitor= and how to reload a graph and pick
up new classes.  I augmented the Developer Guide to describe how you would use
a =Monitor= and a =ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= with a =ClassfileLoader= to support
reloading the graph and picking up changes.

As I was writing this, I realized that the monitor and the dispatcher are not
linked to one another.  This means that if the dispatcher decides to ignore a
JAR file that hasn't changed, the monitor will not know about the classes in it
and will remove them from the graph if it uses closed sessions.

I had experienced this behavior before, when using the webapp with a collection
of JAR files instead of the loose =.class= files I was used to.  I'm thinking
that if I let the dispatcher travers collections of classes, like JAR or ZIP
files, it would let the monitor know about all the =.class= files and the
monitor would not remove them from the graph.  That's already what
=ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= does with directories.
