Played with [[http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ASH/Home][Ashcroft]] to see how
well-behaved my unit tests really were.  Out of 1403 unit tests, 1224 did *not*
pass the test.  This is not totally surprising since most tests get their data
from reading =.class= files.  Also, I couldn't run the tests with Ant because
Ant tries to write test reports to files and Ashcroft won't let it open the
output file.
