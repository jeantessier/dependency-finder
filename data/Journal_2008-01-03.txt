Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>WebWork</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.2.4</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.2.6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I also changed =web.xml= for both webapps to use JSP 2.1 with EL support.  Not
that I'm using any of it yet, but just keeping up-to-date.
