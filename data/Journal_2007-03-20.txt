Accessing fields of other classes is bad.  Even those of your superclasses.  I
just got bit by this with some of my =DoFixture= subclasses.  They called
=setSystemUnderTest()= to set it, but were accessing =systemUnderTest= directly
instead of calling =getSystemUnderTest()= like they should.  Of course, the
latest version of FitLibrary tightened access to this field and now my code is
broken.  Luckily, the easy fix is to get it through the accessor and everything
becomes alright.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>FitLibrary</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>20060116</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>20070217</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
