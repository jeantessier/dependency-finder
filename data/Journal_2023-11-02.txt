Refactored some code to make better use of =switch= expressions.  A long time
ago, I was a big fan of having a single exit point in methods.  I would often
set up a =result= variable at the top of a method and have a single =return=
statement at the bottom.  It helped with debugging because I could put a
=print= statement just before returning and see what was what.  Since then, as
I've been working with other languages, I've become more prone to short methods
that simply return an expression.  So, I'm making a few changes here and there
to make the code "look better".
