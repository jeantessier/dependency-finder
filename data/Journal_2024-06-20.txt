Worked on
issue [[https://github.com/jeantessier/dependency-finder/issues/8][#8]].

I added an indexing _key_ to =Metrics=, separate from their _name_, for use
when tracking metrics.  For project-, group-, and class-level metrics, it is
the same as their name.  But for methods, it is the combination of the method's
signature and its return type.  Some synthetic methods have the same signature
as an existing method, but will have a different return type (e.g.,
[[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.4.5][erasures]],
[[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.4.5][bridge methods]]).

I had to change references to method names to use the _key_ instead, so each
variation gets reported correctly.

I added some tests for the various metrics printers.  Keeping track of all the
hidden vs. empty options was getting too complicated to do in my head.  I put
the expected output in files under =integration-tests/src/test/resources= and
the tests generate an actual output and compare it to the expected output from
the files.  These tests can be somewhat fragile if the output changes a lot,
but I don't feel this will be the case here.  I could use data-driven tests to
generate most variations.  I use the =MartinConfig.xml= configuration because
it has hidden measurements, and it surfaces all variations of empty metrics,
hidden measurements, etc.

In the process of testing the printers, I realized the JSON printer was missing
a newline character at the end of its output.  I had noticed a weird character
when I called =OOMetrics -json=, but never understood that it was because of a
missing newline.  Now, this mystery is solved.
