I finally figured out my problem with Xerces and unit tests.
The Xerces and JUnit's class loading behavior do not play well
together.  I had to craft an =excluded.properties=
file so that Xerces files are not reloaded with every test run.

I finished =MetricsConfigurationHandler=.  In the
unit tests, I tried to test Xerces's XML validation feature.
It load the external DTD, alright, but fails to flag documents
that do not follow the DTD.  So much for that.

To use the validating parser, I had to put the DTDs on:

    [[dtd][https://depfind.sourceforge.io/dtd/]]

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Xerces</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.0.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.0.1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
