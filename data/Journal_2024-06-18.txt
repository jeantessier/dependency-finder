There were some flaky tests in the metrics printers.  Looking into it, it
turned out that when they were generating random percentiles, they sometimes
used the value =0=.  Percentiles have to be =0 < p <= 100=, so a value of =0=
was causing problems.

=OOMetrics= and =ClassMetrics= were only using =Synthetic_attribute= to
identify synthetic elements and they were ignoring elements that have the
=ACC_SYNTHETIC= in their =access_flags=.  I refactored them to use the helper
method =isSynthetic()=, which adequately checks both the attribute and the
access flags.

I also updated both =OOMetrics= and =ClassMetrics= to include reports of all
variations of classes, fields, methods, and inner classes.  They had fallen
behind during the update to Java 21.  I took this opportunity to refactor
=ClassMetrics= to remove a lot of duplication in how it printed reports.  When
I switched them to the Streams API, I mistakenly added quite a few empty lines
in reports with the =-list= switch.  I was able to restore the look of the
reports back to how it was before I decided to use the Streams API, but with
the new additions.
