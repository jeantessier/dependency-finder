There were some flaky tests in the metrics printers.  Looking into it, it
turned out that when generating random percentiles, they sometimes used the
value =0=.  Percentiles have to be =0 < p <%3D 100=, so a value of =0= was
causing problems.

=OOMetrics= and =ClassMetrics= were only using =Synthetic%5Fattribute= to
identify synthetic elements and they were ignoring elements that have the
=ACC%5FSYNTHETIC= in their =access%5Fflags=.  I refactored them to use the
helper method =isSynthetic()=, which adequately checks both the attribute and
the access flags.

I also updated both =OOMetrics= and =ClassMetrics= to include reports of all
variations of classes, fields, methods, and inner classes.  They had fallen
behind during the update to Java 21.  I took this opportunity to refactor
=ClassMetrics= to remove a lot of duplication in how it prints reports.  When I
switched to the Streams API, I mistakenly added quite a few empty lines in
reports with the =-list= switch.  I was able to restore the look of the reports
back to how it was before, while preserving the new additions.
