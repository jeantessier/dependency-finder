Completed support for Java 8 by implementing =MethodParameters_attribute= and
its helper classes.  I first drafted the changes that were required to support
Java 8 back in 2016.  Now, I can say that part is done.

Java 9 defined modules.  The =Module= attribute is a big attribute, but it is
very straightforward.  Nests from Java 11 are trivial.  Records were a big
addition in Java 16, but the =Record= attribute is a name with a descriptor and
an attribute lists.  Easy stuff.  The lastest change to the =.class= file
format was in Java 17 with the addition of =PermittedSubclasses= attribute.  It
aggregates together classes from the constant pool and will also be easy to
implement.

I noticed that the JVM specification uses the plural "access flags" but my code
is using the singular "access flag".  I changed it everywhere to use the plural.
Strictly speaking, it breaks backwards compatibility, but I feel it's minor
enough to slip it by.
