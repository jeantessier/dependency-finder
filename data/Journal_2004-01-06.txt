Someone is asking about classes depending on methods they inherit
from interfaces or abstract supeclasses.  If a concrete class calls one
of its own methods that it inherited from an interface or an abstract
superclass, there is no dependency recorded between the concrete class
and its ancestor.  I'll need to research this a little further.
