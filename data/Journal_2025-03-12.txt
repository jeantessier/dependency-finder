Added new =OOMetrics= measurements for _raw method length_ (=RML=) and
_effective method length_ (=EML=).  =RML= is based on
=max<sub>line numbers</sub> - min<sub>line numbers</sub> + 1=, and =EML= is
based on =|line numbers|= (the cardinality of line number entries).

I also fixed =SLOC= for methods so it includes the method's definition.  For
most methods, it works just fine.  But it also adds 1 "line" to static
initializers.  =SLOC= remains an approximation that is _close enough_.

I made a change to =StatisticalMeasurement=.  When it is empty, it used to
return =NaN= for its sum.  This caused problems when I tried to aggregate
methods lengths at the class, group, or project levels.  I think it is
reasonable to have sum return =0= when the measurement is empty.  I am
beginning to think it wouldn't be a bad thing to have some kind of
_indeterminate_ state for measurements that don't have a definitive value, like
empty stats or some counters that have not been added to.

I started working on a =HistogramMeasurement=.  It aggregates values from
submetrics.  One challenge is figuring out what its =getValue()= should return.
For now, I'm having it return the value of the largest bucket in the histogram.
I am also having it use integer buckets.  It rounds up values to the nearest
integer.  I will need to modify all the measurement printers so they handle
histograms properly.
