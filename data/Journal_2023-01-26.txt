I'm playing with the idea adding JSON and YAML output formats, in addition to
text and XML.  At first, I thought of simply adding new =Printer= subclasses.

I started drafting what the outputs might look like for dependency graphs.

Then, I realized I might be able to pull it off using XSLT.  It wouldn't be
much different from =DependencyGraphToText.xsl=.  It already has logic to treat
inbound and outbound dependencies as separate collections, even though they are
a thrown together in a single collection in XML.
