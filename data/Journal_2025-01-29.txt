Dependency Finder is now 24 years old.

Looking at code coverage data, I realized there was a missing Fit test for
=ListDynamicInstructions=.

There are no Fit tests for =ClassDump= either.  But that is because it is not
even a proper =Command=-based CLI tool.  It was always meant to stand on its
own, with no dependencies outside the JDK.  When =ClassDump= encounters a
=.class= file, it reads it one byte at a time, in a =while (true) {}= loop.
The =EOFException= when it reads past the end of the file will kill it out of
the infinite loop.  This is not very clean, but the I/O interfaces are not very
good at letting me detect the end of the file.

I was curious how big my =.class= files got to be.  The largest one I could
find in the Dependency Finder codebase was =TestXMLPrinter=, in the
=:integration-tests= subproject, at 115KB.  It has a lot of tests and most
of them use jMock to re-create specific situations.  Since most tests didn't
interact with the file system, I broke it down between unit tests and the few
legitimate integration tests.  196 tests ended up moving to the =:lib=
subproject.

I added a navigation bar to the React app.  I couldn't find a standard way of
doing this in React or Vite, so I went with a custom component for now.

I pushed out version =1.4.1=.  While I was following instructions to generate
the sample data for the new release, I realized the Linux scripts were not
escaping spaces correctly.  For example, when I called:

    JarJarDiff -name "Dependency Finder" ...

The differences report had a name of "Dependency" only.  I had to fix the
launching scripts to handle escaped spaces correctly.

I pushed out version =1.4.1.1= with the fixed scripts.  The launching scripts
are the only thing that's changed, so I will not update the documentation and
everything at this time.
