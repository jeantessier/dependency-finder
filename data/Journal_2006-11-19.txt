Refactored =com.jentessier.commandline= to simplify printers for usage and
echo of parsed command-line.  The latter still doesn't echo parameters; it
only does switches at this time.

Refactored =com.jentessier.commandline= to store parameters in the
=ParameterStrategy= instances instead of the =CommandLine=.  Just like switch
values are stored in the =CommandLineSwitch= objects, now the parameters are
also store outside the =CommandLine= object.

Cleaned up classes in the CLI and Ant tasks packages.

Upgraded the following development components:

        <td>6.0.1</td>

    </tr>
