Found a better way to test for components from =LCOM4Gatherer= that is not
order-sensitive.  Right now, the components are stored in a =HashSet=, so the
iteration order during tests would change depending on the implementation of
=HashSet=.  The previous checks in the tests were assuming a specific order, so
the tests were brittle.
