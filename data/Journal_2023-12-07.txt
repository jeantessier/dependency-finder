I successfully separated the pure unit tests from "integration tests" that need
test data: compiled Java code.  The main =:lib= subproject can run all the unit
tests that don't require external data.  The =:integration-tests= subproject
has the sample code that the other tests are running against.  I don't know how
to effectively share test data between projects, yet.  So the tests dig
directly into the subprojects to find what they need.

I moved the webapp code to its own subproject.  It seems to compile fine, but
the HttpUnit tests are broken.  They were broken to begin with, so they will
need more work later.  But the status quo is preserved.
