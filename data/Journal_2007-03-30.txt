Found a bug with OOMetricsGUI where the names of packages, classes, and
features are all prefixed with "com.jeantessier.metrics.Metrics".  It turns out
the cell renderer from Swing calls =toString()= on the object being redered, in
my case they are =Metrics= objects and their =toString()= method adds a lot of
debug information to the string.  I modified =OOMetricsTableModel= to insert
only the name of the =Metrics= in the first column instead of the =Metrics=
itself.

This bug was in Release 1.1.1 and has been around for almost two years before I
noticed it.
