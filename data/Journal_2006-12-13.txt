Refactored =DependencyClosure=, =DependencyCycles=, and =DependencyReporter=
as part of the grand CLI refactoring.

[[http://emma.sourceforge.net][Emma]] recommends that you use an =enabled=
attribute on =&lt;emma&gt;= tags to control whether instrumentation is done or not.
The attribute takes its value from a flag property in the =build.xml= file
under a special target that you put on the command-line, before the =intrument=
or =report= targets.  This way, the flag gets set in the =emma= target so that
it enables the =&lt;emma&gt;= tags in other other targets.

My Emma-related Ant tasks are dedicated to doing code coverage, so I end up
always calling them with =emma= on the command-line.  Since I never turn the
flag off, I removed it altogether and got rid of the =emma= target.  Now, I
will be able to trigger the code coverage targets from within IntelliJ.

Refactored =Command= to remove duplication when populating groups of related
switches, such as for start and stop criteria and for filtering.
