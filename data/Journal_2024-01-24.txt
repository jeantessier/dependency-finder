Replaced Log4J with Log4J2.  This meant changing =log4j.properties= to
=log4j2.properties= and adapting it to the new format.  I could have used the
XML format, which all Log4J2 docs use, or the YAML format, but the properties
file seemed most straightforward way to go for now.

I also figured out how to copy JAR files from Gradle dependencies, instead of
fetching them by hand and hard-checking them in Git.  As a result, I had to
rework the launching script to dynamically build a =CLASSPATH= from the list of
JAR files in =lib/=.

I don't know how to do that under Windows, so all the Windows launching scripts
are broken at the moment.

I removed the scripts to run JUnit since I run JUnit through Gradle, now.

I removed the scripts to run Chainsaw since it no longer ships with Log4J, but
as a [[https://logging.apache.org/chainsaw/2.x/][separate download]].
