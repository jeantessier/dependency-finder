The text output from =ListSymbols= can be used with =-includes-list= and
=-excludes-list= command-line switches.  Methods will have their full signature
matched against these lists, so I needed to change =TextSymbolPrinter= to show
full signatures instead of _unique names_.

I took the opportunity to rename the switches to =ListSymbols=.  Since it
reports more than just names, now, I removed the _name_ part of the switches.

    * =-class-names= &rArr; =-classes=
    * =-field-names= &rArr; =-fields=
    * =-method-names= &rArr; =-methods=
    * =-local-names= &rArr; =-local-variables=
    * =-inner-class-names= &rArr; =-inner-classes=

and

    * =-non-private-field-names= &rArr; =-non-private-fields=
    * =-final-method-or-class-names= &rArr; =final-methods-or-classes=
