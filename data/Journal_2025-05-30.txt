Back on 2025-05-26, the continuous build started taking much longer than usual.
It usually takes about 4.5 minutes, but on that day I killed one after 15
minutes and another one after 9 minutes.  I hoped it was some factor beyond my
control in the GitHub cloud, or something.

Today, I upgraded Gradle to =8.14.1= and the CI stalled again while setting up
Gradle.  I noticed the =gradle/actions/*= actions had had a major version
number update.  Maybe the newer version would work better.  While I was
researching this, the CI actually finished.  It had taken more than 30 minutes.
With the updated action, it's back to around 4 minutes.  Coincidence?!?
