Refactored Log4J calls to use lazy string interpolation.

Lines like:

    debug("msg " + val);

became:

    debug("msg {}", val):

So Log4J only does the string interpolation if the log is enabled.

Some lines where a value was expensive to compute became:

    debug("msg {}", () -> val);

So that even the computation is deferred until the log actually needs it.
