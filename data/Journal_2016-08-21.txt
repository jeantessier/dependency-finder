I've been looking at what's needed to bring the =com.jeantessier.classreader=
package up to date with the latest JVM spec for Java 8.  I already took care of
the new constant pool elements, but there are new attributes too.  And those are
not trivial.

Here is the class structure that supports Java 4.  The constant pool is in blue
and the various attributes are in yellow.

And here is the class structure needed for Java 8.  The new elements are in
green.

Bear in mind, these are only the public interfaces in
=com.jeantessier.classreader= that will be visible to other callers.  There will
also be implementation classes in =com.jeantessier.classreader.impl= and
additional support classes, like factories for the =Target=, =StackMapFrame=,
and =VerificationType_info= hierarchies.  It will also impact implementation of
the =Visitor= interface.
