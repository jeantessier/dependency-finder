Removed the synchronization around the firing of events.  Synchronizing the
list of listeners makes a lot of sense if listeners keep registering and
de-registering while we are firing events.  But in Dependency Finder, we set up
the listeners are the beginning and don't change them once the main processing
starts.  There is no need to synchronize this list when we are firing events.
I was copying the list of listeners in a synchronized block to keep the
critical section short.  By removing the critical section, I don't need to copy
lists all the time anymore.

I wrote =CodeSpliterator=, as a simile to =CodeIterator=, so the
=Code%5Fattribute= can expose a =Stream&lt;Instruction&gt;= via its =stream()=
method.
