I'm going to skip the remainder of Java 5 support for now.  Generic signatures
don't add enough information to what's already there to make it worth the
complexity of parsing their signatures.  And the =StackMap= is just too crazy.
I will look for some lower-hanging fruits, first.

I implemented the =BootstrapMethods_attribute= structure and attendant helpers.
It took all day.  I had a couple false starts and fell in a couple of traps,
but it worked out in the end.
