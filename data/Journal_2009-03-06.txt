Minor changes to phrasing in the Tools page.

Added a link to Pivotal Tracker for Dependency Finder as one of the menu items
on the site's left-hand panel.  I also tried to make the "Download" link stand
out more by using a &lt;strong&gt; tag (I wanted to use &lt;b&gt; but IntelliJ
IDEA complained that it was deprecated and suggested &lt;strong&gt; instead),
but the effect may be too light still.
