Explored using [[http://www.saxonica.com/][Saxon]] for XSLT processing.  I can
run a CLI tool straight out of the JAR file.  I could add its JAR file to
Dependency Finder's =lib/= folder and only change the XSL script templates to
refer to that JAR file only.  One problem, though, the command-line switches to
specify input and output files are different.  (And not to my taste.)

    $ DependencyGraphToHTML -in df.xml -out df.html

would become:

    $ DependencyGraphToHTML -s:df.xml -o:df.html

Unless I parse the parameters inside the script and re-write =in= and =out=
switches on the fly.  I can do it in UNIX shell scripts, but I don't have access
to a DOS machine to do the same for the Windows batch files.

Saxon's HTML output specifies a =DOCTYPE=.  With any =DOCTYPE=, browsers are
more strict with the CSS stylesheet.  Without a =DOCTYPE=, I can get away with
bare numbers when specifying margins.  With a =DOCTYPE=, I have to provide a
unit.  "=50=" has to become "=50px=" or else we lose all indentation in the HTML
output and it looks terrible.  Fixing the CSS stylesheets to be more explicit
is easy enough and doesn't break anything.
