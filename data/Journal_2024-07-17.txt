I want to replace the =cgi-bin/Journal.cgi= script with a static page.  The
script takes too long to generate the contents from all the Journal entries.
I would like to automate the construction of a =Journal.html= static page as
part of the continuous build, so I can still edit individual files for each
Journal entry, but be able to load the Journal quickly when visiting the site.
I have a GitHub workflow that generates =Journal.html= and saves it as a build
artifact.  Next, I need to figure out how to deploy it to GitHub Pages
alongside the rest of the website.
