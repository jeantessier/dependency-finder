I want to replace the =cgi-bin/Journal.cgi= script with a static page.  The
script takes too long to generate the contents from all the Journal entries.
I would like to automate the construction of a =Journal.html= static page as
part of the continuous build, so I can still edit individual files for each
Journal entry, but be able to load the Journal quickly when visiting the site.

I had a GitHub workflow that would generate =Journal.html= and saves it as a
build artifact.  I needed to figure out how to deploy it to GitHub Pages
alongside the rest of the website.

I found a "standard" GitHub Pages deployment workflow by playing around with
Pages settings on the GitHub repo.  It packages all files it finds into a
single archive and deploys it to GitHub Pages.  I added steps to generate the
static Journal page and Atom feed (and fixed some URLs), that now I have a CI
that generates the static assets that I need.
