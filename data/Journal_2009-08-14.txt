Refactored =com.jeantessier.metrics.TestMetricsGatherer= so it uses mostly the
new =assertThat()= syntax from JUnit 4.5 intead of the various =assertTrue()=
and =assertEquals()= and so forth.  I was able to simplify the tests drastically
with judicious uses of helper methods and Hamcrest's =hasItems()= matcher.

It is still more an integration test than a pure unit test.  It is somewhat
brittle since it depends on an actual compiled class and lots of internal
details of =com.jeantessier.metrics=, but there is only so much I can do in one
pass.  At least, it is very readalble now that I have removed all the
duplication.
