More experimenting with [[https://micronaut.io/][Micronaut]] and
[[https://nextjs.org/][Next.js]].

I also read an
[[https://www.unlogged.io/post/class-file-api-not-your-everyday-java-api][article]]
on the new
[[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/classfile/package-summary.html][Class-File API]]
that started previewing in Java 22.  It includes features to read =.class=
files, similar to my =com.jeantessier.classreader= package.  The Class-File API
also includes features to generate =.class= files and manipulate code, which I
don't do.
