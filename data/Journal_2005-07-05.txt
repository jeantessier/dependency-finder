Somebody suggested using Dependency Finder to generate data flow
graphs.  They asked if inbound dependencies on fields couldn't map to
setting the value and outbound dependencies to reading the value.  The
goals are different between dependency graphs and data flow graphs.  But
this got me thinking that maybe just having a different collector could
do the trick.  The =Node= class and its related classes are
generic enough to represent any kind of relationships.  It is up to the
consumer of the graph to infer meaning from things like "inbound" and
"outbound" nodes.
