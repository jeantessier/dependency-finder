My neighbor works for DreamWorks and did the illustrations during
the rolling credits at the end of Shrek 2.  They look like medieval
vignettes of various activities, but he somehow managed to have them
represent modern activities of movie making, such as sound mixing and
such.

I asked him if he could do icons for Dependency Finder in the same
style and he said he'd look into it.  So I put together a list of the
icons and how they're used for him to look at.  I hope it works out, it
would be very cool.
