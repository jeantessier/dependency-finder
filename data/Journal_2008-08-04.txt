Fixed =TestSymbolGathererStrategyDecorator= so it tests the right class, and
not one of its descendants.

The fields of =MaximumCapacityPatternCache= were package-level instead of being
private for some reason.  I suspect that a manual refactoring was the cause.  I
made them private and neither the compiler nor the tests complained about it.

Finished =FilteringSymbolGathererStrategy=, including tests, and used it in the
CLI version of =ListSymbols=.

Normalized the names of tests for =SymbolGathererStrategy= implementations.

Clamped down on non-private fields, mostly in test classes.  I used the new
functionality in =ListSymbols=.

    $ ant -f build.test.xml compile
    ...
    $ bin/ListSymbols -non-private-field-names classes
    ...

There were a few in test code, mostly oversights from promoting local variables
to fields manually.  There are still a few public fields in the code to support
Fit test.
