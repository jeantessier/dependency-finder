Use specialized collections in =com.jeantessier.metrics=.

Worked on =MetricsGathererFixture=, trying to find a good way to represent
metrics in a fixture.

I tried to use FitLibraryRunner20060110, which seems to be the latest version
of FitLibrary, but it eludes me.  =DoFixture= has changed package.  The HTML
pages now use CSS to manage colors and state and it seems I have to copy the
stylesheet myself between the folder with the input files and the folder with
the output files.  And apparently, =DoFixture= now works differently, because
I can many complaints about methods not being found, whereas it used to find
them just fine using introspection on my classes.

I tried FitLibraryRunner20060110 because there was an incompatibility between
FitLibraryForFit15Feb2005 and the latest fit-java-1.1.  I was able to do a
small change to FitLibrary and recompile it againt Fit 1.1, but I'm not sure
how the versioning of FitLibrary works.  The new FitLibraryRunner20060110 has
all the Fit classes inside of it, so I only need one JAR file.  But it seems
some of the semantics have changed along the way and I haven't seen any
documentation so far.  I'll have to dig some more.
