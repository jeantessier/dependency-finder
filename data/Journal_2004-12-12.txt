Wrote a section of the User Manual to describe how you can limit the
API diff report of a third-party library to the subset of that API that
you are using in your code.

Found a bug with the CLI scripts.  When I generated the template for
1.1.0 beta3, I used an example that lacked the Xerces libraries.  This
means that all tools that need to read XML couldn't find a proper
parser.  Since no one has complained yet, I guess they all use the GUI
or the Ant tasks.  I won't write a patch for this since the official
1.1.0 release is very close and will have the correct scripts.

Had a similar problem with the XSL scripts, but in reverse.  Most of
them are straightforward XSL transformations and only require Xalan
JARs.  But =PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl= uses some custom code
and needs Dependency Finder's JARs.  I changed the template to include
them all the time, just like the Unix template was doing.
