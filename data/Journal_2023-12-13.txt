Fixed Ant targets for Tomcat 7+.  I have an experimental branch from
[[2011-05-19]] that was trying to do that too.  I had noted back then that
HttpUnit tests wasn't able to launch the webapp.

Fixed webapp descriptor location in =:webapp= subproject.  Gradle expects all
webapp-related files to be under =src/main/webapp=.

Fixed location of javadocs and GUI resources in =:lib= subproject.  Gradle
expects all non-Java files to be under =src/main/resources=.

Cleaned up distribution files to remove duplicate JAR files.
