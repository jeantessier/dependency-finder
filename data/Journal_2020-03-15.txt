Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>4.12</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>4.13</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tomcat</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>9.0.19</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>9.0.31</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I still have 78 failing tests.  :-(

Many of the tools that I was using 10 years ago either don't exist  anymore or
have widely evolved in incompatible ways.  Many of them can  only download from
Maven.  My instructions for setting up a developer  environment are pretty much
obsolete.  People have been asking for the ability to download Dependency Finder
from Maven.  And it would be nice to write tests in Spock (and write code in
Groovy, for that matter).  I have some thinking ahead of me.
