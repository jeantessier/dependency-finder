Updated the JUnit dependency to JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5).  The tests are still
written for a mix of JUnit 3 and JUnit 4, but at least the package dependency
should now be up-to-date.  I received a security warning from GitHub, and I'm
hoping this upgrade addresses it.

I also added a step in the GitHub Actions workflow to report on tests that
pass and/or fail as part of the job summary.  The information I need is in XML
files produced by JUnit.  I used Ruby and the =nokogiri= gem to parse the XML
and generate a Markdown table.  I am not too keen to introduce yet another
language, Ruby, in Dependency Finder.  But, it is the quickest and simplest way
to parse XML files and extract the information I need.  It is only in the
GitHub Actions workflow.  For now.

I could extract the test summary logic into my own GitHub Action, separate from
Dependency Finder.  This would keep the Ruby code out.  This new action could
either be a Docker container or a composite action that calls Ruby from the
runner's shell.

Someone wrote a =[[https://github.com/test-summary][test-summary]]= GitHub
Action that does a similar job.  This could be a way to not have to
introduce Ruby into Dependency Finder.
