I moved the Ant logic that was in =integration-tests/jarjardiff/build.xml= to
the `:integration-tests:jarjardiff:old` Gradle subproject.  I managed to create
the archives in the `old` subproject, but I'm not quite sure on the best way to
move them back up to either the `jarjardiff` subproject or the
`integration-tests` subproject.  For now, the tests that use these archives use
explicit paths into the `old` subproject's `build/` folder.

Now, I can run `./gradlew check` from a clean folder, and it takes care of
everything.
