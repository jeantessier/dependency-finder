I moved the Ant logic that was in =integration-tests/jarjardiff/build.xml= to
the =:integration-tests:jarjardiff:old= Gradle subproject.  I managed to create
the archives in the =:integration-tests:jarjardiff:old= subproject, but I'm not
quite sure on the best way to move them back up to either the
=:integration-tests:jarjardiff= subproject or the =:integration-tests=
subproject.  For now, the tests that use these archives use explicit paths into
the =integration-tests/jarjardiff/old/build/archives= folder.

Now, I can run:

    ./gradlew check

from a clean folder, and it takes care of everything.
