Moved the logic to build unique names for method metrics to =Feature_info= and
=FeatureRef_info=, so they can be consistent across client packages.  Fields
just use their name, and methods append their return type to their signature.
Constructors and class initializers are exempt.

I also updated the copyright notice to 2024.
