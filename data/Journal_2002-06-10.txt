I'm not going to make it.  I wanted to finish the first
beta release before going on vacation next week, but I'm
not done with the coding and there is a lot of documentation
to write still.  I'll do a date-tagged release with all the
code fixes so I can close the bugs and do the beta later,
when I've had some time to write good docs and package the
whole thing properly.  I've updated the release plan
accordingly.

Worked on dependency-related metrics.  I think I've got
it nailed down, but I need to write more tests.

Made progress with SLOC.  Methods are pretty good.
Fields are accounted for.  I've added one for the class
declaration.  I still need to work out =try {=
lines.

I got feedback regarding =ListDiff= and
=PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl=.  I need to do more
testing to make sure that they compute differences
correctly.
