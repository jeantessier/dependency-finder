There is a curious check in =DifferencesFactory= when dealing with removed
methods.  It checks that either both =oldClass= and =newClass= are classes, or
both are interfaces, before marking a removed method as being inherited.  I
found a note, dated [[2001-04-05]], that discusses methods that are now being
inherited.  Back then, interfaces could not provide implementations, so a class
could not inherit a method implementation from an interface.  I did think, at
the time, of an abstract class inheriting a method declaration only.  Now,
interfaces can supply a default implementation for their methods.  So, a class
can (or an interface) can inherit declarations as well as implementations from
their parents, superclasses or superinterfaces.  I went ahead and removed this
extra check that is no longer relevant.

I wrote some tests first, this time.

The note from 2001 says that removed features should only be shown if they are
not inherited from a parent.  The XML output from =JarJarDiff= will continue to
show the declaration, but mark it with =inherited%3D"yes"=.  The HTML output
from =DiffToHTML= will drop it, so it does not confuse diff reports.
