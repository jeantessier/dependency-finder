Finished converting all the integration tests to JUnit Jupiter.

I started converting some unit tests, too.  I created the class
=com.jeantessier.MockObjectTestCase= as an almost drop-in replacement for the
one from jMock for Junit 3.  It saves me from having to edit all the calls
to =mock()= and =checking()=, but the name is ugly.  I still have to edit all
the assertions, mostly to put the error message as the last parameter.  It's
tedious work.
