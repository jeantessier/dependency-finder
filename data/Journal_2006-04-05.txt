Got FitLibrary's =FolderRunner= to run under JUnit.

Tried Subversion for version control.  With TortoiseSVN, a Windows Explorer
plug-in, I can checkout the project just fine.  With the official, command-line
client, it kept dropping the connection.  I tried the integration in IntelliJ
and SmartSVN, but they were having difficulties too.  Strange, and annoying.
Now, I wonder if I wouldn't be better staying with CVS.

Moved Fit test images to =files= folder so =FolderRunner= can copy it to the
=reports= folder.
