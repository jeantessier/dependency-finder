Removed the dependency on [[https://github.com/google/guava][Guava]].  I wasn't
really using it and some of the functionalities have equivalents in recent JDK
versions.  This makes one fewer external dependency to manage.

I could go one step further and replace Jakarta-ORO with =java.util.regex=.  It
would allow me to get rid of =MaximumCapacityPatternCache=.  But the
Jakarta-ORO API is so much simpler.

And if I were to replace Log4J with =java.util.logging=, I would have no
external dependencies at all.  I like the Log4J API much more, though.
