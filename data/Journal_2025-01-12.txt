I think I found a workaround for my problems with DOT files.  I added a switch
to =DependencyReporter= to force it to output nodes that match the filter
criteria, along with nodes that match the scope criteria.  The new switch is
called =-include-filter-nodes=.  With it, the XML output will have everything
needed by =DependencyGraphToDOT= to render the graphs I want.

I also changed the URL prefix for DTDs from =https://depfind.sourceforge.io/=
to =https://jeantessier.github.io/dependency-finder/=.   This way, these
resources will come from the official site on GitHub instead of the old site
back on SourceForge.
