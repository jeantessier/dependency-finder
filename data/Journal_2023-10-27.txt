Added =Module_attribute= and its helper classes processing in =VisitorBase= and
=XMLPrinter=.

I made one change that is not backwards compatible: in =classfile elements, the
=module= element is now called =is-module=.  This lets me repurpose =module= to
represent module references that are part of =Module_attribute=.
