Fixed instrumenting code for code coverage.  When going from Java =1.7= to Java
=1.8=, the JVM became more strict when validating bytecode.  The instrumented
bytecode is failing this stricter validation in Java =1.8=.  Passing the
=-noverify= JVM arg allows it to skip this verification and run the instrumented
code just the same.

- *Emma*: code coverage now works with Emma =2.0.5312=.
- *Clover*: Clover =1.3.13= is still failing to create its coverage database.
- *Cobertura*: Cobertura =1.9.3= cannot handle try-with-resource code.
