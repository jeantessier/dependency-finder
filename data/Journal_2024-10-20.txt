Found a "bug" in =com.jeantessier.dependency.JSONPrinter=.  It rendered boolean
values for confirmed nodes as the strings ="true"= and ="false"=, instead of
the raw boolean values =true= and =false= that are allowed in JSON.  I had to
fix quite a few test data templates.  The templates didn't end with a newline
character because I compared them to the printer's output, which doesn't have
one either.  But IntelliJ IDEA decided to add a newline on each file that I
touched, out of the goodness of its heart.  I would have been tedious to open
each file in another editor, just to remove a newline.  So, I adjusted the test
to add a newline to the printer's output instead.
