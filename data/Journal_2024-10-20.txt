Added a fully functional =/query= page to my React app.  You can specify scope
and filter criteria, run the query, and view the results.  It doesn't do graph
surfing or set query string search parameters, yet.  And, I don't know if I
will get to the Advanced Query page.  I might do closures and metrics first.

I found a "bug" in =com.jeantessier.dependency.JSONPrinter=.  It rendered
boolean values for confirmed nodes as the strings ="true"= and ="false"=,
instead of the raw boolean values =true= and =false= that are allowed in JSON.
I had to fix quite a few test data templates.  The templates didn't end with a
newline character because I compared them to the printer's output, which
doesn't have one either.  But IntelliJ IDEA decided to add a newline on each
file that I touched, out of the goodness of its heart.  I would have been
tedious to open each file in another editor, just to remove a newline.  So, I
adjusted the test to add a newline to the printer's output instead.
