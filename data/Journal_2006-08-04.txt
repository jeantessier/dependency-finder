Played a bit with [[http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/][TeamCity]], by the
makers of IntelliJ IDEA.  While I was trying to set it up for Dependency
Finder, I was confronted with the fact that I create the distribution files in
the same folder as the =build.xml= file.  I should really put them in their
own folder, like =dist/=, so TeamCity can recognize them as build artifacts.
It would also align my build better with the best practices out there.
