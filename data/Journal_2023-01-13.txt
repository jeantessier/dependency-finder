Wrote =VisibilitySymbolGathererStrategy= to filter symbols based on their
visibility, as determined by access flags.  I realized that top-level classes
can only be =public= or else package-visible, but inner classes use the full
range of visibility.  =ListSymbols= does not look at inner class metadata, but
I will need to make it do so to properly filter inner classes.
