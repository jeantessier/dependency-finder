Experimented with [[https://micronaut.io/][Micronaut]] to see how I could add
the JAR files for Dependency Finder to a Micronaut app and call its classes
from the application.  I managed to wire together a simple =/version= endpoint
that returns data from the =Version= bean inside Dependency Finder.  I could
create controllers that rough match the JSP pages in =:webapp=.  I'll have to
figure out how to move a Micronaut app from a top-level Gradle project to a
subproject in Dependency Finder.

I have an XSLT stylesheet to convert dependency graphs from XML to JSON.  But,
I don't have a way to generate JSON directly from within the application.
