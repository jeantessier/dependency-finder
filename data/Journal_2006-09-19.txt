I starting to lose patience with =ServletUnit=.  This is a case where I can do
something in 10 minutes, but it is taking me weeks to get it under test.  This
is frustrating.  If I don't find a way to get =ServletUnit= to work soon, I
will have to drop it and go without test for the outermost layer of the UI.

I took a look at JUnit 4.1.  It uses annotations to mark the test methods and
the fixture setup and tear down code.  It would be a significant effort to
switch to JUnit 4.  Plus, I hear that support in IntelliJ and Ant is still
behind.  I think I'll stick with JUnit 3.8.2 for now.
