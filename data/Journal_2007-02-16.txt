Tech doc for CLI version of =DependencyCycles=.  Changed _scope_
switches / attributes to _start_ ones instead, similar to =DependencyClosure=.

Changed =CommandLine.getSwitch()= to throw an =IllegalArgumentException=
instead of a checked =CommandLineException= when it cannot resolve a switch
name.  This simplified the signature of many methods that deal with setting up
the =CommandLine= object in the CLI.

Fixed a bug in =DependencyCycles= where it was opening its own writer instead
of using the one setup by its superclass.  Revised all writer usage across CLI.
