Fixed the servlet-based webapp so it properly escapes =()= and =[]= and =\=
and =$= characters when you click on a name in a dependency graph.

I also updated the copyright notice to 2025.

I added the link to Perl regular expressions in the Manual to the React app.
And I copied inputs to and from the URL's search params.  I am still figuring
out how to trigger a call to the backend when parameters are passed in the URL.
