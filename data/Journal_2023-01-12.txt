A user asked for a way to limit =ListSymbols= to public and protected features.
There are a number of decorators for the =SymbolGathererStrategy= that
=ListSymbols= uses to filter symbols, but none of them match this specific
requirement.

I would like to add a new decorator subclass that would filter based on
visibility, but the test matrix is daunting.  I looked a doing
[[https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests][parameterized tests]]
in JUnit, and found a way in JUnit5.  I'm still on JUnit4.  I will need to
figure out the impact of an upgrade.   I now wish I had a
[[https://gradle.org/][Gradle]] project setup so I could use
[[https://spockframework.org/][Spock]] and write my tests in
[[https://groovy-lang.org/][Groovy]].

Maybe I can use Fit tests instead, to minimize the immediate impact.
