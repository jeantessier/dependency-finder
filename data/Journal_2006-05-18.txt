Re-did the text rendering of =Cycle= from scratch.  This time, I created unit
tests around =TextCyclePrinter=.  Getting Fit to process text somewhat properly
was more difficult than I expected.  At first, I tried using _check_ rows, but
it got confused by \r\n versus \n line terminations.  Then, I tried using and
=ArrayFixture= to break down the lines of the text, but when Fit reads in the
expected cells, it strips the leading whitespace, which again breaks text
comparison.  For now, I check indentation in unit tests and general order of
the lines in Fit.
