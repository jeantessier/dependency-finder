New =AliasSwitch= to handle command-line switches that are simply an alias for
a collection of other switches.  This way, =com.jeantessier.commandline= can
handle aliases and their rendering in usage messages instead of each individual
CLI command.  I modified =DependencyReporter= and =DependencyMetrics= to use
the new aliasing mechanism.  I had to modify =CommandFixture= so I could test
command-line parsing and alias configurations as part of the Fit tests.

I refactored the buffer handling in =com.jeantessier.commandline.Printer= to a
new class =com.jeantessier.text.PrinterBuffer=.  Other printers will be able
to use it too to remove code duplication between them.  I already modified
=com.jeantessier.diff.Printer= and =com.jeantessier.diff.ListDiffPrinter=.
Other printers will take longer because they are wrappers around =PrintWriter=
instead of =StringBuffer=.

Figured out how to exclude sample classes that are only test data from Emma
reports.  I cleaned up =build.emma.xml= and the procedure for running the
coverage report to make it much simpler.  I no longer need to invoke a separate
target from =build.text.xml= to generate the rest of the test data.
