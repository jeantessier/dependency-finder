Playing with [[http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/][Jetty]], I managed to make it
serve a complete web app straight from the WAR file.  This simple program takes
a port number as the first parameter and a WAR file as the second.

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Server server = new Server(Integer.getValue(args[0]));

        WebAppContext webapp = new WebAppContext();
        webapp.setContextPath("/");
        webapp.setWar(args[1]);

        server.setHandler(webapp);

        server.start();
        server.join();
    }

For now, the web app takes its configuration from the =web.xml= file that is
buried in the WAR file.  I'll have to figure out a way to pass in the values
for the =source= and =file= context parameters.
