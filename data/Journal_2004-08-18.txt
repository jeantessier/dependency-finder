At work, we're using
[[http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/][HtmlUnit]]
to test a web app through a browser.  I really like the way it
simulates the user connection and allows you to query the resulting
HTML, including following hyperlinks and submitting forms.  This could
be very helpful in testing Dependency Finder's web app.
