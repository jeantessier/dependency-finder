I used =ClassMetrics= to see which attributes I'm currently skipping in a given
codebase.  I looked at Dependency Finder itself, a JAR file that was in my JDK
installation, and the JAR files for Groovy.  =StackMap= is by far the most
common attribute being skipped at the moment.

I took another look at what I would need to support it.  There are many
ancillary classes that will require interfaces in =com.jeantessier.classreader=
and implementations in =com.jeantessier.classreader.impl=.  I looked at how I
had done it for =ElementValue= and I could see a way through if I skimped on
the testing for the more obvious wiring bits.

I implemented the =VerificationTypeInfo= parts.  In doing this, I came upon a
way to test even the wiring with some judicious data-driven tests.  I haven't
made them =Visitable=, yet.  The total support for =StackMap= will add many,
many methods to =Visitor= and I will do them all at once.

Working on =VerificationTypeInfo= gave me a path through implementing
=StackMapFrame= next.  The tagging for frames is different from what I've
encountered before.  Previous tags were each discreet values.  Specific
characters for =ElementValue= and specific integers for
=VerificationTypeInfo=.  But =StackMapFrame= uses ranges.  This is going to be
fun!
