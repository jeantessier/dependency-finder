I switched the XML formats to use an external DTD instead
of an internal one, like I've been doing so far.  Not that I
have an "official" web site, I can store the DTDs there for
all to share.  When the release is ready, I'll put the DTDs
at:

    [[dtd][https://depfind.sourceforge.io/dtd/]]

I have got a design for the configuration of metrics system.
I have started writing some unit tests.
