Finally got back to working on =SignatureHelper= to process the signature of
generics.  For starters, I simply copied the code from =DescriptorHelper= and
modified it slightly.  I will need to figure out how to extract common code
to a shared superclass.  I also added Fit tests for =DescriptorHelper= and
=SignatureHelper=, to eventually replace the JUnit tests.  It is easier to
test multiple operations on a given string using Fit tests than with JUnit,
which would require a certain amount of code duplication.
