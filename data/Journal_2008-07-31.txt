Documented the new switches to =ListSymbols= on the the Tools page.

Fixed tests broken by new switches to =ListSymbols=.

Streamlined the building of =CLASSPATH= in =junit= and =textjunit= launcher
scripts under Unix.

Switched =textjunit= to use the normal JUnit 4.4 test runner instead of the old
=junit.textui.TestRunner=.

I noticed that the graphical UI launched by =junit= is now broken.  It has most
likely been broken since I switched to the JUnit 4.4 binaries back on
[[2008-06-09]] but I had not noticed.  I might get rid of the graphical
launcher altogether if I cannot find a suitable replacement to
=junit.swingui.TestRunner=.

Brought the =ListSymbols= Ant task to feature parity with its CLI version.

Started to create tests for the Ant version of =ListSymbols=, but the Ant code
is not very testable.  The Ant tasks have many trivial accessors that I do not
want to waste time testing.  The interesting business logic is embeded in the
=execute()= method and I have to pull it out before I can write tests against
it.

The project's website is in SourceForge's Subversion repository and I update it
from SourceForge's Shell service.  I noticed today that the Shell service
couldn't talk to the Subversion service for some reason.  Someone else is
having the same problem, so at least it's not just me.  Apparently, SourceForge
is in the process of moving its infrastructure, so maybe it's related somehow.
