Got an idea to characterize nodes in the dependency graph between
nodes that represent elements that are only referenced by analyzed code
versus nodes that represent elements that underwent analysis.  I was
trying to track dependencies in a piece of software and hit a wall when
I tried to see if anybody accessed private methods of an implementation
class.  All the other methods it inherited from superclasses kept
showing up too.

Under JDK 1.4, dependencies are resolved to the exact type of the
reference.  For example, in the case of the Template Method pattern,
if the client calls the template method on the concrete subclass, it
creates a dependency to a shadow template method on the subclass, not
the actual template method in the abstract superclass.  This is a new
form of interface polution where a class can have symbols that it does
not necessarily define but that it rather inherits from a superclass.
These can create false impressions when running dependency analysis
because you can miss actual calls to a method that are attributed an
hypothetically overriden version in a subclass.

I could have Dependency Finder figure it out, somehow.
