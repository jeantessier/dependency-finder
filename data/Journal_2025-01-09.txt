Converting more unit tests to JUnit Jupiter.  I migrated all tests to jMock
with JUnit Jupiter.  I migrated all JUnit 4 parameterized tests to JUnit
Jupiter parameterized tests.  I migrated all JUnit 4 tests to JUnit Jupiter.
I used a Perl script to do some of the more tedious conversions, but I still
had to manually inspect hundreds of files.  All I have left are a bunch of
JUnit 3 tests in =com.jeantessier.dependency=, and then I'll be all on the most
up-to-date JUnit.
