I need to add a JSON output to dependency metrics from =DependencyMetrics= so
they can be fed from the Micronaut service to the React frontend.

I was looking at =MetricsReport=.  It exposes charts, but each of the eight
charts are the same lengths, padded with zeroes as needed.  This seems wasteful
to me.  I added a _histogram_ version of each chart that only includes parts
where there is actual data.

I also split the old =MetricsReport= into an abstract base class
=MetricsReport= that has all the flags, and a specific =TextMetricsReport= for
the details of writing textual metrics reports.  With this split in place, it
will be a little bit easier to introduce a class that renders the report as a
JSON object.
