Started working on =WordCounter= to count the number of words in identifiers,
including package names.  Adjusted =MetricsFactory= to use it in computing the
number of words in package and class names.  I still need to deal with method
names.

I might have to start creating metrics for individual fields.  That might be
quite a bit of work.

Cleaned up =MaximumCapacityPatternCache= and its tests to remove unsued imports
and use specialized version of collections.
