Dependency Finder: social networking for your code!

Cleared up the documentation regarding the web application and how
to get a dependency graph loaded.

Also changed the obscure =delta= application variable
to the more aptly named =duration=.  It tells how long the
last extraction or loading took.  In the case of extracting a graph,
I should probably have separate numbers for the last full extraction
and the last update only.

On my new PC, I can't seem to start Tomcat on port 8080.  It keeps
complaining that port 8080 is already in use, but I can't figure out
by what.  I've changed the default config to port 8000 in the meantime
and it seems to work just fine.
