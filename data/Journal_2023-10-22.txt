Implemented the =StackMapFrame= parts, including a =StackMapFrameFactory=.  I
did all the wiring for =Visitable= and =Visitor= support.  I implemented
rendering as XML using =XMLPrinter=.

I adjusted the Release Plan to have separate items for each Java version that
introduced changes to the =.class= file format.  I filled in dates for the work
I've just been doing.  The remainder work for Java 8 through 21 should be
straightforward.  (The last change was for Java 17.)
