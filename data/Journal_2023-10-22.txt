Started support for Java 8.  Implemented
=RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations_attribute= and
=RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations_attribute=, along with their helper classes.
It turned out to be trickier than I expected.  The =TypeAnnotation= is
especially gnarly, with lists of unions of bespoke micro-structures.  I have
looked at many JAR files on my laptop in various Java-based tools and
libraries, but I still haven't found a class with either one of these
attributes.

I'm updating the DTD for =classfile=.  It was missing many attributes
definitions.
