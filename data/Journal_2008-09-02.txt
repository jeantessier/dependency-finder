Spiked to try out SLOC2, based on the minimum and maximum line numbers in a
method and in a class.  Running it on Dependency Finder, it yields estimates
that are about 60% higher than SLOC.  This is due in part to blank lines and
comments, which it counts.  Interestingly, it finds nothing for interfaces and
abstract methods.

In the process, I got the idea to split the different concerns in
=StatisticalMeasurement=: collecting a bunch of values and running statistical
analysis on those values.  To compute SLOC2, I needed a collection measurement
where I could collect the different line numbers and get the minimum and
maximum values.  I used a =SumMeasurement= to compute _max - min + 1_.  With
separate measurements for collecting values and doing statistics, it would make
the metrics config even more complex, so it may not be a win for the user.
