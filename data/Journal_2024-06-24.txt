Continued work on
issue [[https://github.com/jeantessier/dependency-finder/issues/8][#8]].

It turns out everywhere in =OOMetrics= where I used a method's signature ended
up using the new _key_.  So, I faced reality and make this _key_ the actual
name of method-level metrics.

Completed the tests for all metrics printers.  They now cover all outputs and
a few additional variations.
