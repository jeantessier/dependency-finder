Someone on Mastodon asked a
[[https://techhub.social/@paintgoblin@warhammer.social/113136435478210877][question about identically named methods]],
but with different return types.  This is a good example of _bridge methods_.
It is very timely that I recently learned about these.

I came up with a nice little example to illustrate.

    public interface Shape {}
    &nbsp;
    public interface Factory {
        Shape create();
    }
    &nbsp;
    public class Circle implements Shape {}
    &nbsp;
    public class CircleFactory implements Factory {
        public Circle create() {
            return new Circle();
        }
    }

Now, =CircleFactory= has two =create()= methods: one is a bridge method that
returns a =Shape=, and the other is the method from the source that returns a
=Circle=.
