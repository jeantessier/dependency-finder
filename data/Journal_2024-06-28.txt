Use methods' unique name in the dependency graph.  And also for fields, for
good measure.  As it turns out, all that was required was to update a regex in
=NodeFactory= and another regex in =TextPrinter=.

=OOMetrics= relied on =Deprecated%5Fattribute= to find deprecated classes.  But
it used =Feature%5Finfo.isDeprecated()= for fields and methods.  I removed the
inconsistency, and now =OOMetrics= no longer looks at =Deprecated%5Fattribute=
directly.  It's all hidden behind =isDeprecated()= methods.
