Adjusted =DiffToHTML= to mark inherited features instead of silently ignoring
them.  The silencing logic was overly simplistic; it left behind potentially
empty "Removed Methods" sections, and putting a conditional on that heading
could leave behind empty classes.  I tested it out with cases where I moved a
method up a class hierarchy.  It was a better experience to show the removed
method with an indication that it was now being inherited than to leave it out
altogether.

I, again, had to re-create the "recent" API changes for Dependency Finder using
the latest version of =JarJarDiff= and the new version of =DiffToHTML=.  Again,
"recent" means versions =1.2.1-beta3= and later.
