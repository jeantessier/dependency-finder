I found a library in Java to generate test objects with random data.  It is
named [[https://www.instancio.org/][Instancio]].  I read about it in
[[https://rieckpil.de/generating-java-test-data-with-instancio/][this article]].
It looks somewhat akin to the
=[[https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory%5Fbot][factory%5Fbot]]= gem in Ruby,
and the Faker= library in [[https://rubygems.org/gems/faker][Ruby]] and
[[https://fakerjs.dev/][JavaScript]].
