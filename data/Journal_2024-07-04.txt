Is changing a signature to remove the need for a bridge method a change in
signature or the removal of a method?

For example, imagine we have an API package defining interfaces for a =Foo=
abstraction and its factory =FooBuilder=.

    package org.ietf.foo;
    &nbsp;
    public interface Foo {}
    &nbsp;
    public interface FooBuilder {
        Foo buildFrom(String name);
    }

If we can implement these interfaces in a separate implementation package, we
can match the names of the classes to the interfaces they implement.

    package com.acme.impl;
    &nbsp;
    public class Foo implements org.ietf.foo.Foo {}
    &nbsp;
    public class FooBuilder implements org.ietf.foo.FooBuilder {
        public *Foo* buildFrom(String name) {
            return new Foo();
        }
    }

Since there are no =import= statements, the implementation of =buildFrom()= has
a return type of =com.acme.impl.Foo=.  Since it is a subtype of the =Foo=
interface, it satisfies the contract of =buildFrom()= from the =FooBuilder=
interface.  But the compiler will create a _bridge method_ with the correct
return type and have it call our implementation.

We can alleviate the need for a bridge method by giving our implementation the
correct exact return type.  It makes the implementation more verbose and
potentially harder to read, though.  Which is why we were using the form with
the bridge method in the first place.

    package com.acme.impl;
    &nbsp;
    public class Foo implements org.ietf.foo.Foo {}
    &nbsp;
    public class FooBuilder implements org.ietf.foo.FooBuilder {
        public *org.ietf.foo.Foo* buildFrom(String name) {
            return new Foo();
        }
    }

Now, the code looks as follows.

[[../images/FooWithBridgeMethod.png]]

If I run both versions through =JarJarDiff= while it is using method
_signatures_ to analyze differences, it reports:

    *Method Changes:*
        *old*:public com.acme.impl.Foo buildFrom(java.lang.String)
        *new*:public org.ietf.foo.Foo buildFrom(java.lang.String)

That is, it completely ignores the bridge method and compares the change in
the implementations of the interface.

But when I modify =JarJarDiff= to use methods' _unique name_ instead, it
reports:

    *Removed Methods:*
        public com.acme.impl.Foo buildFrom(java.lang.String)

The bridge method is matched to the new implementation, and the old
implementation has nothing to compare it against.

So, which is the correct interpretation?  Is it a method change or did we
remove a method?
