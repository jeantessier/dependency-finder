Build initial support for distinguishing between referenced versus
concrete nodes in the dependency graph.  =NodeFactory= now
has versions of its =createX()= methods that take a boolean
parameter to mark nodes as concrete.  The default is for them to be
marked as referenced only.  Marking a node as concrete makes its
ancestors concrete, but not its sibblings nor descendants.
