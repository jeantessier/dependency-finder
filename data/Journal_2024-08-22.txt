Created a GitHub Actions workflow to generate releases.  I found a way to pass
in the =VERSION= value to And, and through it, to Gradle.  This way, Gradle can
include it in the JAR file's manifest, and Ant can use it when it generates
the Manual and Tools pages, as well as naming distribution files.

I found a trick where pushing a tag can trigger a workflow.  The workflow has
access to the tag name, so it can pass it to Ant and Gradle.  I also found a
GitHub Action that creates a release in GitHub and uploads the distribution
files to it.

All I have left is to make the workflow create the Docker image and upload it
to Docker Hub.
