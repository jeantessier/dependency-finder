Finished removing the explicit =public= qualifiers from interfaces in
=com.jeantessier.classreader=.  I also moved some behavior from abstract base
classes to default methods in their related interfaces.

More =for()= loops converted to Stream API.  More dead code removed, more
hand-written mocks replaced with jMock.
