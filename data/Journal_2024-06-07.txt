Looked at adding percentiles to =OOMetricsGUI=.  I haven't looked at the Swing
code that makes up the GUI applications since I first wrote it over 20 years
ago.  It uses sets of constants to build column names, so the set of subvalues
is essentially hard-coded.  I will have to do some major refactoring of the
models that feed the GUI to make column names more dynamic and make them based
on what's in the metrics configuration.
