Got an idea for undoing extraction of a single class on the graph.
If I can do that, then I can re-extract a single class that I just
recompiled and see it's effect on the graph without re-extracting the
whole graph.  I'm still strugling with detecting if a file has changed
since it was last extracted, so I can launch a re-extraction on a whole
codebase and have it pick only the files that have changed.
