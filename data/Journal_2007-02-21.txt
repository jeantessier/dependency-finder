Fixed the =ParameterStraregy= for =ClassReader=, =DependencyClosure=,
=DependencyCycles=, =DependencyMetrics=, and =DependencyReporter=.  When I
refactored the CLI into =Command= subclasses, I inadvertently removed the
constraint that these tools require at least one file to work on.  I looked at
the dependencies on =ParameterStrategy= constructors between version 1.1.1 and
the latest code and I could determine which CLI commands needed a different
strategy from the others.

Created a launch script for Log4J's Chainsaw.  Between times that I actually
need to look at logs to debug something, I keep forgettting how to start it.
This way, I don't have to remember anything.
