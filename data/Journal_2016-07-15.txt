Played with replacing the [[http://ant.apache.org/][Ant]] build script with
[[https://gradle.org/][Gradle]].  It has a number of pre-defined tasks to deal
with Java project.  It also expects a certain code organization that echoes what
I have seen on other projects.  Source code is under =src/main/java= and unit
tests are under =src/tests/java=.  It is possible to change these defaults to
match legacy projects, but I'm more tempted to move files around to match these
growing best practices.

I can declare dependencies in =build.gradle= and Gradle will download them
automatically.  Such as:

    compile "log4j:log4j:1.2.17"
    compile "oro:oro:2.0.8"
    compile "com.google.guava:guava:r08"

I can also include dependencies for WebWork and such.

I need to find better examples on how to deal with launch scripts and web
applications.
