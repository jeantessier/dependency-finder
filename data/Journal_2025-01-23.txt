Found a problem with JSON and YAML printers and irregular values.  An empty
=StatisticalMeasurement= has all sub-values as =NaN=.  It is possible for a
=RatioMeasurement= to have a value of =NaN=, infinity, or negative infinity,
which Java renders as ="NaN"=, ="Infinity"=, and =-"Infinity"= respectively.

JSON does not have a representation for these values.  I changed the printers
to put =null= instead.

YAML does have representations for these values.  I changed the printers to put
=.NaN=, =.Inf=, and =-.Inf= as appropriate.  YAML is not case-sensitive, but I
liked these capitalized versions.

And it was not just the printers, but the =MetricsToJSON= and =MetricsToYAML=
XSL stylesheets too.
