Found a problem with JSON and YAML printers and irregular values.  An empty
=StatisticalMeasurement= has all sub-values as =NaN=.  It is possible for a
=RatioMeasurement= to have a value of =NaN=, infinity, or negative infinity,
which Java renders as ="NaN"=, ="Infinity"=, and =-"Infinity"= respectively.

[[https://www.json.org/json-en.html][JSON]] does not have a representation for
these values.  I changed the printers to put =null= instead.

[[https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/][YAML]] does have representations for these
values.  I changed the printers to put =.NaN=, =.Inf=, and =-.Inf= as
appropriate.  YAML is not case-sensitive, but I liked these capitalized
versions.

And it was not just the printers, but the =MetricsToJSON= and =MetricsToYAML=
XSL stylesheets too.

With these fixes in place, I was able to add the =/metrics/ page to my React
app and complete it.  I also used
[[https://echarts.apache.org/][Apache ECharts]] to render the dependency
metrics chart and all the histograms.
