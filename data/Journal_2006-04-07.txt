Finished converting all my development environments to Subversion.

Fixed =TestDirectoryExplorer= to use dedicated temporary files instead of some
arbitrary folder within the project.  The tests would break everytime that
folder would gain or lose files.  With the switch to Subversion, there was an
explosion of ancillary files that finally decided me to do something about this
test.
