Opened a ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1499643&group_id%3D1&atid%3D200001][1499643]])
with SourceForge about my commit problem.  Apparently, I am not the only one.
I found at least one other ticket
([[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1499575&group_id%3D1&atid%3D200001][1499575]])
with the same problem and others are also having trouble commiting but get
different error messages.

Fixed my issue with table width in the new webapp pages for dependency cycles.

I tried to load the webapp with the dependency graph for Dependency Finder and
find class-level cycles starting at =com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor=,
specifying it a maximum cycle length of 5.  The CPU went to 100% for over two
hours and never came back.  In the end, I had to kill Tomcat.  I'll have to
investigate why this happened and if it is a bug or just that =CycleDetector=
is not really useful in real life.

Found out SourceForge added a new permission on user accounts for Subversion
access.  I granted myself permission but it didn't work right away.  I guess
there is a propagation delay between the user management system and the
permission system.  It's all better now.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Tomcat</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>5.5.15</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>5.5.17</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
