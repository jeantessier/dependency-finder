Did a quick study of the download rates for Dependency Finder, based on the
statistics from SourceForge.  It's nice how downloads flow from one release to
the next, except that every once in a while, some of the old releases still get
downloads even when there are multiple new releases after them.  I wonder what
could motivate someone to fetch an old release.  Release 1.1.1 is holding up at
over 300 downloads per month; I'm happy.
