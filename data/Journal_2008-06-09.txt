Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>3.8.2</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>4.4</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I haven't changed any of the test classes yet.  I just ugrapded the JAR file
that I use in compilation.  Everything should still work with older versions of
JUnit, except =junit.bat= and =textjunit.bat= which refer to the JAR file by
name explicitly.
