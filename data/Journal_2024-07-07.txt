Used GitHub Actions to create the distribution files and store them in GitHub
Packages.  I will figure out how to create a release from them later.  The
examples I have to study use a tool to generate semantic versions, but I am not
quite ready for that.

I also added a workflow to compile the Journal entries into a single HTML file.
I could use it on the
[[https://jeantessier.github.io/dependency-finder/][github.io]] to have the
Journal page there too.  I cannot run CGI scripts on GitHub, so I have to find
a way to render static contents instead.
