Fixed the broken tests.

In one case, the compiler was optimizing away the unused variable =c= in the
sample =test= class.  I figured a way to tweak the code so the compiler would
keep the variable by declaring it in an enclosing scope.

Tests for =CodeDependencyCollector= were testing filtering by excuding
=/java.lang/= and making sure =java.lang= entities were absent from the
dependency graph.  But after I added inheritance data to the graph, it became
impossible to avoid =java.lang.Object= since =test= derives from it.  So I
switched the package to exlcude to =java.io= instead.

I realized that when I ran tests with Ant instead of =textjunit=, some tests
were failing.  I had to add JUnit classes to the =CLASSPATH= used by Ant's task.

Finally, all the tests for =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.web= are failing
because they use HttpUnit, which is broken.  I've excluded these tests for the
time being, until I can find another way to test JSPs.
