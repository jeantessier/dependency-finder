I noticed that the =mnemonic()= column in =Instruction.html= was not turning
green or red as tests passed or failed.  I was using an HTML =class= attribute
on the cell to give it a monospaced font, but that interfered with Fit's
coloring scheme, which also uses a =class= attribute on the cell.  The browser
was using only the first =class= attribute and ignoring the one from Fit.  I
took mine out; it doesn't look as pretty now, but it is much more useful this
way.

In OO, a _signature_ is something that uniquely identifies a method, typically
it is its name and the type of each parameter, in order.  But Java 1.5
introduced a different meaning to the word _signature_: the generic information
around a class, field, or method declaration.  Java in general uses the work
_descriptor_ to refer to the combination of return type and parameter types of
a method.  The object model in =com.jeantessier.classreader= uses _signature_
in the OO sense and builds it from the method's name and descriptor information.
But I feel this may get confusing as I expose the Java 1.5 =Signature_info=
data.  I am debating whether I should rename all my =*Signature= methods to
=*Descriptor= instead; maybe even going as far as leaving the method name out
of them and let callers combine them as appropriate.  I'll need to look into
this more closely.

=Feature_info= already has a =getDescriptor()= method that returns the raw
string that describes the _descriptor_ (in the Java sense).
