I managed to fix the connection between the Micronaut microservice and the
React frontend, even through an =ngrok= tunnel.  After digging through the
[[https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode][Vite documentation]], I moved the
=.env.local= file that was setting the service URL to =http://localhost:8080=.
By renaming it to =.env.development=, it now only applies in development mode,
and it is no longer part of the final build.  There, it uses
=[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location][document.location.origin]]=
instead.  So, whatever URL gets you to the app also gets it to the service.

I used the same URL for actions in the service and pages on the frontend, which
can lead to confusion.  If you go to =/= and then navigate to =/extract=, you
get the Extract UI.  If you go directly to =/extract=, you get a JSON with
Extract metadata.  So, I moved the actions in the service to =/api= URLs.  Now,
you can no longer go directly to =/extract=, it only works when navigating from
the home page.  You can reach the Extract action by going to =/api/extract=.

There are a few things I stil need to work on:

    1 The Micronaut app needs a better name than =[[https://github.com/jeantessier/micronaut-depfind-test][micronaut-depfind-test]]=.
    1 I don't like the package name for the Groovy code, =micronaut.depfind.test=.
    1 The Home page for the React app is still the default Vite demo page.
    1 I need to make the navigation accessible on all pages.

But, all the major functionality is there.
