The next release will be =1.4.0=.  The change to method unique names will break
some setups out there, just like I've been updating regular expressions in
Dependency Finder itself.

I renamed the =master= branch to =main=.

I've been experimenting with GitHub Actions.  I set up a workflow that runs
=./gradlew build=, which builds everything and runs all tests.  I still have to
figure out how to publish distributions and Docker images from GitHub Actions.
