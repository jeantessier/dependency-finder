Found a bug in =OOMetrics=.  Group-level basic measurements were not being
computed for _defined groups_, that is, groups that don't match a Java package
name, but rather a regular expression in a =group-definition=.  The metrics
gatherer was only computing them for the group metrics of the current package.
It was never looking for matching defined groups.

I also moved the =P= measurement for packages from the top-level project to each
group, and used a =SubMetricsAccumulatorMeasurement= to aggregate them at the
project-level.  Groups that represent individual packages will have a value of
=1=, but defined groups using regular expressions can cover multiple packages.
