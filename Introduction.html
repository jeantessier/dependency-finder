Code analysis, API diffs, OO metrics ...</p>

<h2>Dependency Finder</h2>

<p>Dependency Finder is a suite of tools for analyzing compiled Java code.  At
the core is a powerful dependency analysis application that extracts dependency
graphs and mines them for useful information.  This application comes in many
forms for your ease of use, including command-line tools, a Swing-based
application, a web application ready to be deployed in an application server,
and a set of Ant tasks.</p>

<p>JarJarDiff is another important tool in the suite.  It compares two versions
of the same codebase and reports the differences in the API.  It lists new,
changed, and removed elements such as packages, classes, methods, and more.
You can tailor the reports to focus on your public, published API versus the
private, internal one.</p>

<p>Finally, Dependency Finder has a tool for computing object-oriented software
metrics that give you an empirical quality assessment of your code.  Once again,
you can tailor the report to focus on the metrics that you care about and adjust
validity thresholds to the specifics of your project.</p>

<h3>Why use Dependency Finder instead of the alternatives?</h3>

<p>Dependency Finder is not the only game in town.  Tools like IntelliJ and
Xrefactory have great features that let you track down usage of selected
classes or methods.  So why should you bother with yet another tool?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>By the way, I keep an informal list of the competition on the
<a href="Resources.html">resources</a> page.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, Dependency Finder is <b>free</b>.  Free as in "free beer"
since it costs no money; and free as in "free speech" since you can get the
sources and do whatever you want with them (except take my name off, that
is).</p>

<p>Dependency Finder has a <b>powerful</b> querying mechanism based on Perl
regular expressions.  Whereas other tools can show you usage for a single
method, Dependency Finder can show you usage for many methods, and possibly all
of them, at a single glance.  For example, "Show me all calls to constructors
of this class."  With other tools, you have to select each constructor in turn,
have the tool generate usage information for it, save the results, and
aggregate them later somehow, if at all.  I don't know about you, but I have
more important things to do, like fix bugs and write new feature.</p>

<p>The web application lets you <b>share</b> a dependency graph with your
entire team.  Anyone can query the graph with nothing more than a browser.
They don't have to install anything or wait after the tools to extract a graph
from code.  The graph is there, all the time, at everyone's disposal.  You can
even have your nightly build regenerate the graph after each successful
compilation run.<p>

<p>Dependency Finder can compute <b>closures</b>, that is, follow dependencies
and find everything reachable from a given start point.  This can help you
package related components together, or verify that your code respects
encapsulation.</p>

<p>And Dependency Finder includes many <b>more</b> tools.  See the
<a href="Manual.html">user manual</a> and the
<a href="Tools.html">tool list</a> for all it has to offer.</p>

<h3>Why bother with dependencies at all?</h3>

<p>Many authors have stressed the importance of managing depencencies
(<a target="_blank" href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/listArticles?key=author&author=Robert%20C.%20Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633620/o/qid=980962318/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/105-0176284-9920776">John Lakos</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/coupling.pdf">Martin Fowler</a>).
Managing dependencies means securing encapsulation and making sure that the
code follows the architecture.  It is also essential for the modularization of
code and favors reuse.  By extracting the information from the code itself, we
can detect where we were sloppy, where we took shortcuts that we shouldn't
have.  Managing the dependencies can even shorten the compilation time of the
code.</p>

<p>At first, I thought of using the Reflection API, but it showed only the
class's attributes and method signatures.  If a method used some other class
for a local variable or called a static method, that dependency that would not
show under the Reflection API.  So I had to build a suite of tools that could
extract dependencies from compiled Java code directly.  The tools can get all
the necessary information out of the <code>.class</code> files.</p>

        Dependency Finder is a critical component in our manufacturing process.
        We have been building our product since 1996, we initially wrote a
        homegrown Dependency Analysis program for a few small applet jar files.
        But as our product grew our Dependencies increased, and so did the time
        needed to analyze the results.  We hadn?t created a database in our
        homegrown system.  Dependency finder reduced the time our system took
        from 2 hours to 5 or 6 minutes.  Today we use Dependency Finder to
        determine the contents of 21 jar files.<br />
        <br />
        Another major advantage of using Dependency Finder is to be compatible
        with the Microsoft 1.1 JVM issues.  We needed to compile select class
        files with the javac -target 1.1 option, so the Applets would run in
        the OLD JVM.  We first compile with the newest compilers, then analyze
        the results and recompile only the necessary classes with the older
        compiler target.<br />
        <br />
        Thanks a lot for producing this great program.

	Dependency Finder is an integral part of the everyday development
	work as well as of the nightly build at our company.<br />
	<br />
	We are using its Ant tasks in our nightly build to generate the
	dependency graph of our entire suite of 23 subprojects (7000 classes).
	This graph is then loaded into our Tomcat servlet engine and stays in
	memory during the work day for interactive queries from development
	machines which execute in a matter of seconds.<br />
	<br />
	We are also utilizing the implementation of the standard object-
	oriented metrics of Dependency Finder extracted from the dependency
	graph to get an overall idea of where software rot has begun. What
	would be even better is getting adequate visual representation of
	the current stand of our  Java source and pinpointing offending
	packages or classes according to easily configurable criteria.<br />
	<br />
	All in all, Dependency Finder is a reliable, high-quality tool
	which is versatile enough to be used in batch as well as in
	interactive mode. It is well suited to be used for project
	comprehension and management.

	After source control and Ant, Dependency Finder is the most used

	because of search with regular expressions.  Through its Ant extensions,
	the Finder is linked to our nightly build and automates tasks like
	comparing APIs and enforcing system dependency rules.  We use Metrics
	to help determine if work on a subsystem will require a new branch.  It
	has delivered more productivity than any other build system we use.
