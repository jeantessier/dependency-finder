---+++ Third-Party Packages

Dependency Finder uses a number of third-party packages, especially for
testing.  Everything you need to run Dependency Finder is in the distribution
files, but you will need additional software if you want to compile your own
custom version and/or run the test suite.  The tables below list those
third-party packages, where you can find them, and which version we have tried
Dependency Finder with.  Older or newer version have a good change of working
too, but these are tried and true.

For simple compilation:

<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Tested Version</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Tomcat</td><td>[[http://tomcat.apache.org/][tomcat.apache.org]]</td><td align="center">5.5.17</td></tr>
    <tr><td>WebWork</td><td>[[http://www.opensymphony.org/webwork/][www.opensymphony.org/webwork]]</td><td align="center">2.2.4</td><td style%3D"font-size: small">You may need to change the JAR's name in <code>[text]junit[.bat]</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

For testing:

<table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Location</th><th>Tested Version</th></tr>
    <tr><td>JUnit</td><td>[[http://junit.org/][junit.org]]</td><td align="center">4.5</td></tr>

---++ Contributing to Dependency Finder

I spend a lot of my personal time on Dependency Finder and I have grown very
attached to it.  I work very hard to keep the code quality as high as I can,
and in order to do that, I must retain strict control over what goes into
Dependency Finder.  I take great pride in the work I do on Dependency Finder
and that is part of why all the package names start with "=com.jeantessier=".

If you have built some great addition or enhancement to Dependency Finder,
there are two ways you can share it with the world and help Dependency Finder
(and yourself too).

---+++ Separate Project

The best way to share your addition/enhancement with the world is for you to
create your own open source project.  [[http://sourceforge.net/][SourceForge]]
can help you with this and there are other alternatives.  With your own project,
you can take all the credit for your work and manage it the way *you* want to.
You are free to redistribute Dependency Finder with your code.  You don't have
to make your project open source if you don't want to, you can charge for it or
release it to the public domain.  The Dependency Finder license is very lax,
you can do pretty much what you want with it as long as my name remains on the
Dependency Finder code.

By pointing to the Dependency Finder project from your project, you help it
show up on web search engines like [[http://www.yahoo.com/][Yahoo!]] and
[[http://www.google.com/][Google]].  This raises awareness of Dependency Finder
and helps it gain popularity.  I will, of course, return the favor and mention
you project on the Dependency Finder website.  This way, we both help each
other.

---+++ Assimilation

Another, less desireable, option is for you to surrender your code to me for
inclusion in Dependency Finder.  I will review your code thoroughly and I may
modify it extensively to make it meets *my* standards of quality (I'm not
necessarily claiming that my standards are better, but they are *mine*) and
that it fits well with the rest of Dependency Finder.  In the end, your code
will end up in a =com.jeantessier= package and will bear the standard license
header.  Your name and the nature of your contribution will be listed on the
Dependency Finder website and in some of the documentation, but most likely
nowhere in the code itself.

---+++ Money

At this time, I do not accept any monetary contributions or any other form of
compensation.  The only thing I get out of Dependency Finder is the joy to
know people are using my stuff and actually finding it useful.  I don't even
accept donations as some people might construe it entitles them to
_something_.  If you want to help the project, simply tell a friend, or two,
or three ...

----

---++ Class Files

You use the =com.jeantessier.classreader= package to parse compiled
Java code.  You feed =.class= files to a =ClassfileLoader= and you get
instances of =Classfile= back.

---+++ =ClassfileLoader=

<div align="center">
    [[images/ClassfileLoaders.gif]]
*=CLassfileLoader= Hierarchy*
</div>

Here is the basic interface for =ClassfileLoader=:

<div class="highlight">

    public class ClassfileLoader {
        public void *load*(Collection filenames) {
        public Collection *getAllClassfiles*();
    }

</div>

At the most simple, you can just call =load(filenames)= and then iterate over
the =Classfile=s from =getAllClassfiles()=.

<div class="lowlight">

    Collection sources = /%2A Get filenames to read ... %2A/
    ClassfileLoader loader = new AggregatingClassfileLoader();
    loader.load(sources);

    for(Classfile classfile: loader.getAllClassfiles()) {
        /%2A Do something with classfile ... %2A/
    }

</div>

This approach has a few drawbacks.
First, it requires you to read all the =.class= files into memory before you
can start processing them.  Often, processing one class does not require any of
the others, so this is potentially using up a lot of memory needlessly.
Second, there is no way for you to monitor classes as they are being loaded.
This comes in handy for showing progress indicators.

For those reasons, you should use an event-driven approach instead.  You can
implement the =LoadListener= interface and register with the =ClassfileLoader=
by calling =addLoadListener(listener)= (not shown above).  Your implementation
will receive various callbacks as the =.class= files are read in to let it know
how things are progressing.

<div class="lowlight">

    class MyLoadListener implements LoadListener {
        public void endClassfile(LoadEvent event) {
            Classfile classfile = event.getClassfile();
            /%2A Do something with classfile ... %2A/
        }
        /%2A ... %2A/
    }

    Collection sources = /%2A Get filenames to read ... %2A/
    LoadListener listener = MyLoadListener();
    ClassfileLoader loader = new TransientClassfileLoader();
    loader.addLoadListener(listener);
    loader.load(sources);

</div>

The =ClassfileLoader= classes you will use the most often derive from
=ClassfileLoaderEventSource=.  These loaders are the ones who actually create
instances of =Classfile=.  They also keep track of =LoadListener= objects and
drive the event model associated with parsing class files.

There are two concrete subclasses of =ClassfileLoaderEventSource=:

   * AggregatingClassfileLoader
   * TransientClassfileLoader

=AggregatingClassfileLoader= keeps a reference to every =Classfile= it loads.
You can access them through =getAllClassfiles()=.  =TransientClassfileLoader=,
on the other hand, does not hold on to any of them.  It simply drives the event
loop.  It's implementation of =getAllClassfiles()= returns an empty collection.

=ClassfileLoader= has only one public method for loading classes that takes a
collection of names.  This defines a session.  The listeners will receive a
=beginSession= event at the beginning of the method and an =endSession= event
just before the method returns.  Each name in the collection defines a group.
This can be a JAR file, a Zip file, a directory hierarchy containing =.class=
files, or even a single =.class= file.  The processing of each group starts
with a =beginGroup= event and ends with an =endGroup= event.  The loader treats
a group as a collection of files.  Each file is processed in turn, begining
with a =beginFile= event and ending with an =endFile= event.  The loader uses
a =ClassfileLoaderDispatcher= instance to determine how to process a file.  If
the file is a =.class= file (as per the dispatcher), the loader finally starts
processing it, surrounded by a =beginClassfile= event and an =endClassfile=
event.  The =EndClassfile= event will have a reference to the newly loaded
=Classfile= instance.

Node that the various =begin???= events are not guaranteed to be matched by
corresponding =end???= events.  Various errors can lead to the loss of events.

In summary, you can get instances of =Classfile= either from =endClassfile=
events or by querying the loader.  Once you have them, you can traverse them
with objects that implement =com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor=.  They have
callback methods that get called by the various parts of =Classfile= objects.

=EventSourceClassfileLoader= uses other =ClassfileLoader= implementation to
process the various kinds of files it encounters.  Depending on the nature of a
file, as determined by its dispatcher, the loader uses one of three _decorator_
loaders to actually open input streams to individual class files.  These
decorators are subclasses of =ClassfileLoaderDecorator=.  They are:

   * DirectoryClassfileLoader
   * ZipClassfileLoader
   * JarClassfileLoader

A decorator opens input streams from the data sources and passes them to an
underlying =ClassfileLoader=.  The reason for the distinction is to separate
concerns of how long the =Classfile= instances remain in memory from concerns
about how to open various input file types.

---+++ =Visitor=

We use =Classfile= instances to represent the data in =.class= files.  We just
saw how to get =Classfile= instances using a =ClassfileLoader= and the
event-driven mechanism.  Now, =Classfile= is actually the root of a large set
of objects that represent all the details of a compiled Java class.  Traversing
this complex object graph can be non-trivial and is very repetitive.  This is
why Dependency Finder uses the Visitor pattern as a means of traversing
=Classfile= data.

You can implement the =com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor= interface to
traverse =Classfile= structures.  It has callback methods that get called on
various parts of the structure.

One easy solution is to have a class that implements both =LoadListener= and
=Visitor= with the following =endClassfile()= method:

<div class="lowlight">

    class MyListenerAndVisitor implements LoadListener, Visitor {
        public void endClassfile(LoadEvent event) {
            event.getClassfile().accept(this);
        }
        /%2A ... %2A/
    }

</div>

You might end up having quite a few visitors, all duplicating this piece of
code.  So we already provide it as part of the Dependency Finder library.  The
class =LoadListenerVisitorAdapter= takes a =Visitor= and hands it over to
=Classfile= instances are they are made available by the =ClassfileLoader=.
With it, your class only needs to implement the =Visitor= interface and can
focus on the processing at hand, instead needing a series of empty methods to
satisfy the =LoadListener= contract.

<div class="lowlight">

    class MyVisitor implements Visitor {
        /%2A ... %2A/
    }

    Collection sources = /%2A Get filenames to read ... %2A/
    MyVisitor visitor = MyVisitor();
    ClassfileLoader loader = new TransientClassfileLoader();
    loader.addLoadListener(new LoadListenerVisitorAdapter(visitor));
    loader.load(sources);

</div>

<div align="center">
    [[images/LoadListenerVisitorAdapter.gif]]
*=LoadListener= to =Visitor= Adapter*
</div>

Look at the code of =ClassMetrics= for an example of using the Visitor
pattern to traverse =Classfile= instances.

----

---++ Dependencies

You create a dependency graph with a =NodeFactory=.  The factory keeps track
of the package nodes at the top of the graph and all their surbordinate nodes.
Individual nodes keep track of their outbound and inbound dependencies.

You extract dependencies from =Classfile= instances with a
=CodeDependencyCollector=.  You can either give it your own =NodeFactory= or
you can let it create an empty one for you.  =CodeDependencyCollector= is a
=Visitor=, so you can register it with a =ClassfileLoader= using a
=LoadListenerVisitorAdapter= so it will visit each =Classfile= as it is loaded.

<div class="lowlight">

    Collection sources = /%2A Get filenames to read ... %2A/
    NodeFactory factory = new NodeFactory();
    Visitor visitor = CodeDependencyCollector(factory);
    ClassfileLoader loader = new TransientClassfileLoader();
    loader.addLoadListener(new LoadListenerVisitorAdapter(visitor));
    loader.load(sources);

    /%2A Further processing using factory ... %2A/

</div>

<div align="center">
    [[images/CodeDependencyCollectorEventChain.gif]]
*Processing files with =CodeDependencyCollector=*
</div>

=CodeDependencyCollector= fires its own set of events during processing.  If
you are interested in those events, simply implement =DependencyListener= and
register yourself with the collector through its =addDependencyListener()=
method.  Processing a =Classfile= begins with a =beginClass=
event and ends with an =endClass= event.  As the processing unfolds, it will
fire a =dependency= event for each dependency in encounters.  Please note that
while the dependency graph shows only a single dependency for
=A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B=, the collector can potentially fire multiple
=dependency= events for it if it occurs more than once in the code.  It is also
impossible to determine the order of calls from the dependency graph, but the
events arrive in the order the dependencies are discovered.

For example, if you take the following method:

<div class="highlight">

    public void f() throws Exception {
        try {
            out.write("abcd");
        } catch (java.io.IOException ex) {
            out.close()
        }
    }

</div>

Processing it will fire the following events in this order:

   1 =f() --&gt; out=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.io.Writer=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.io.Writer.write(java.lang.String)=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.lang.String=
   1 =f() --&gt; out=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.io.Writer=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.io.Writer.close()=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.io.IOException=
   1 =f() --&gt; java.lang.Exception=

No. 4 comes from analyzing the signature of =write()=, *not* from the constant
="abcd"=.  No. 8 comes from looking at exception handlers.

Because =Node= uses =Set= to store dependencies on other =Node=s, duplicate
dependencies are removed.  No. 1 and No. 5 above are duplicates.  No. 2 and
No. 6 are duplicates too.  In the end, the graph would look as follow:

<div class="lowlight">

    f()
        --&gt; java.io.IOException
        --&gt; java.io.Writer
        --&gt; java.io.Writer.close()
        --&gt; java.io.Writer.write(java.lang.String)
        --&gt; java.lang.Exception
        --&gt; java.lang.String
        --&gt; out

</div>

---+++ =DependencyExtractor=

Let's take a look at =DependencyExtractor= and see how it uses what we've seen
so far to generate a dependency graph.  Here is the core part of the =main()=
method from =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.cli.DependencyExtractor=.  The
Ant equivalent is very similar.

<div class="highlight">

    01:    List *parameters* = commandLine.getParameters();
    02:    if (parameters.size() == 0) {
    03:        parameters.add(".");
    04:    }
    05:
    06:    VerboseListener *verboseListener* = new VerboseListener();
    07:
    08:    NodeFactory *factory* = new NodeFactory();
    09:    CodeDependencyCollector *collector* = new CodeDependencyCollector(factory);
    10:
    11:    ClassfileLoader *loader* = new TransientClassfileLoader();
    12:    loader.addLoadListener(new LoadListenerVisitorAdapter(collector));
    13:    loader.addLoadListener(verboseListener);
    14:    loader.load(parameters);

</div>

On lines 1 through 4, we set _parameters_ to a list of file and directory
names, similar to what you would expect on =CLASSPATH=.  The =ClassfileLoader=
will explore each one in turn, looking for =.class= files.  Typically, I give
it a single directory where my compiled classes are, such as =classes/=, or a
single JAR file, such as =myapp.jar=.  For large projects, I have sometimes
give it multiple JARs, though now =ClassfileLoader= is smart enough to search
for them automatically if I put all the JARs in one directory, such as =lib/=.

Line 6 sets _verboseListener_.  It is only there to provide a progress
indicator for the user.  It counts how many files are slated to be processed
and listens to "beginFile" events to tell the user how many percent-complete.
It also displays the name of files are they are being processed.  There is a
=VerboseListenerBase= in the =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder= package with
common functionality.  Each subpackage (=cli=, =ant=, =gui=, the webapp)
extends it to create its own =VerboseListener= that is specific to that
package's user interface.

Lines 8 and 9 set up the _collector_ that will build the graph and store it in
_factory_.  After all this, _factory_ will contain the resulting graph.

Line 11 creates the _loader_ and lines 12 and 13 attach our two listeners to it
so they will receive =LoadEvent=s.  Notice how we use a
=LoadListenerVisitorAdapter= to tie the _collector_.  Again, _verboseListener_
on line 13 is only there to help keep the user appraised of what is going on.

With the entire event pipeline in place, we finally put it all in motion on
line 14 by passing it the _parameters_.  After control returns from =load()=,
the dependency graph is in _factory_.

What I typically do is pass =factory.getPackages().values()= to some visitor.
All visitors have a =traverseNodes()= method that takes a collection of
=Nodes=.  So it usually looks like:

    visitor.traverseNodes (factory.getPackages().values());

You might also want to look at =GraphCopier= and =GraphSummarizer= as example
visitors.  They use two factories and a =TraversalStrategy= to make a partial
copy of a graph.  You can take a look at =query.jsp= for an example of how this
is done.  It uses the graph in the _factory_, select specific nodes and
dependencies from it according to the =TraversalStragey=, and copy them to
their own internal =NodeFactory= instances.  Then, the JSP runs a =Printer= on
the scope =NodeFactory= from the copier, not the original _factory_.

---+++ Updating the Graph for Changed Files

So far, we have looked at extracting a brand new graph.  For a large codebase,
this can take a while.  It would be nice if, after making a simple change, we
could refresh the graph quickly by having it re-extract only those files that
have changed and adjust the graph accordingly.

<div align="center">
    [[images/ExtractingWithMonitor_class.gif]]
*Updating a Graph using =Monitor=*
</div>

<div align="center">
    [[images/ExtractingWithMonitor_sequence.gif]]
*Updating a Graph using =Monitor=*
</div>

---+++ =extract.jsp=

Let's take a look at =extract.jsp= and see how it generates a dependency graph
and how it differs from what we saw for =DependencyExtractor=.  Here is the
core part of the JSP.  The GUI equivalent is very similar, if spread across
multiple classes in the =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.gui= package.

<div class="highlight">

    01:    Perl5Util perl = new Perl5Util();
    02:    Collection *sources* = new LinkedList();
    03:    perl.split(sources, "/,\\s*/", application.getInitParameter("source"));
    04:
    05:    VerboseListener *verboseListener* = new VerboseListener(out);
    06:
    07:    ClassfileLoaderDispatcher *dispatcher* = (ClassfileLoaderDispatcher) application.getAttribute("dispatcher");
    08:    if (dispatcher == null || request.getParameter("update") == null) {
    09:        dispatcher = new ModifiedOnlyDispatcher(ClassfileLoaderEventSource.DEFAULT_DISPATCHER);
    10:    }
    11:
    12:    NodeFactory factory = (NodeFactory) application.getAttribute("factory");
    13:    if (factory == null || request.getParameter("update") == null) {
    14:        factory = new NodeFactory();
    15:    }
    16:
    17:    Monitor *monitor* = (Monitor) application.getAttribute("monitor");
    18:    if (monitor == null || request.getParameter("update") == null) {
    19:        CodeDependencyCollector *collector*       = new CodeDependencyCollector(factory);
    20:        DeletingVisitor         *deletingVisitor* = new DeletingVisitor(factory);
    21:
    22:        monitor = new Monitor(collector, deletingVisitor);
    23:    }
    24:
    25:    ClassfileLoader *loader* = new TransientClassfileLoader(dispatcher);
    26:    loader.addLoadListener(verboseListener);
    27:    loader.addLoadListener(monitor);
    28:    loader.load(sources);

</div>

Lines 1 through 3 set up _sources_, the equivalent of _parameters_ from
=DependencyExtractor=.  We have already covered the purpose of
_verboseListener_, _factory_, and _collector_.

Lines 7 through 9 set up a special _dispatcher_ for the _loader_.  It has to do
with the webapp being a long-running process and =extract.jsp= being able to
only reload the classes that have changed since "the last time."  Here, the
code uses a =ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= to remember what was done "the last time."
This dispatcher is stored in the session and passed to the =ClassfileLoader=.
That is, unless the user chooses to discard the current graph and start all
over, in which case the JSP creates a brand new _dispatcher_.

The JSP also saves _factory_ in the session to make it available to the other
JSPs that make up the web application.  Lines 12 through 15 deal with
retrieving back from the session or creating a new one, as appropriate.

Lines 17 through 23 create the _monitor_ that will apply changes to the graph.
This is the second part of figuring out what "the last time" was.  It, too,
keeps track of files as they are flying by on the event pipeline.  When the
_loader_ reloads a =.class= file, the _monitor_ will first call =removeClass()=
on _deletingVisitor_ to remove the previous dependencies regarding that class
from the graph.  It then passes the event along to the _collector_ to add the
new dependency information.  Just like the _dispatcher_ earlier, the _monitor_
is saved in the session and reused between invocations, unless the user decides
to start over, at which point the JSP simply create a brand new one instead of
reusing the one in the session.

Lines 25 through 28 serve the same purpose as before in =DependencyExtractor=.
Notice that =Monitor= extends =LoadListenerVisitorAdapter= and does not need
any special treatment before we register it with the _loader_.

---+++ Sample Standalone Application with Refresh

If you are writing your own long-lived application that needs to pick up
changes to the =.class= files, you would setup the =ClassfileLoader= and
dispatcher and visitors once at initialization and hold on to the resulting
loader.

<div class="highlight">

    01:    NodeFactory             factory         = new NodeFactory();
    02:    CodeDependencyCollector collector       = new CodeDependencyCollector(factory);
    03:    DeletingVisitor         deletingVisitor = new DeletingVisitor(factory);
    04:
    05:    ClassfileLoaderDispatcher *dispatcher* = new ModifiedOnlyDispatcher(ClassfileLoaderEventSource.DEFAULT_DISPATCHER);
    06:    Monitor                   *monitor*    = new Monitor(collector, deletingVisitor);
    07:    monitor.setClosedSession(true);
    08:
    09:    *loader* = new TransientClassfileLoader(*dispatcher*);
    10:    loader.addLoadListener(*monitor*);

</div>

Lines 1 through 6 set up the machinery for the _loader_.  We have already
covered the purpose of _dispatcher_, and _monitor_.

Line 7 instructs the _monitor_ to use a _closed session_.  This means that when
the _loader_ sends a =endSession= event, the monitor will remove from the graph
any classes that were not looked at during the session that just ended.  By
default, the _monitor_ uses open sessions and does not remove any classes
(except as part of revising a modified class).

Lines 9 and 10 setup the _loader_ instance for use by the application.

When you want to pickup changes in the classes, all you need to do is call
=load()= on the loader with the location of the =.class= files.

<div class="highlight">

    01:    *loader*.load(sources);

</div>

Here, _sources_ would point to the code that you want to analyze.  The
application would have to execure this line everytime it wants to refresh the
graph, either because it detected a change in the =.class= files or in response
to a user action.

---+++ =Visitor=

You can implement the =com.jeantessier.dependency.Visitor= interface to
traverse a dependency graph.  It has callback methods that get called by the
various instances of =Node= as the traversal progresses.

Look at the code for =DependencyReporter= and =DependencyMetrics= for examples
of using the Visitor pattern to traverse =Node= instances.

If you traverse a standard dependency graph, such as the ones produced by
=CodeDependencyCollector=, you will visit *each* dependency twice.  If we take
the dependency =A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B= as an example, a visitor will see it
once as an outbound node =B= while visiting node =A=, as shown in this call
stack:

    A.Accept(visitor)
        visitor.Visit[Package|Class|Feature](A)
            visitor.VisitOutbound(A.Outbound())
                B.AcceptOutbound(visitor)
                    visitorVisitOutbound[Package|Class|Feature]Node(B)

and a second time as an inbound node =A= while visiting node =B=, as shown in
this call stack:

    B.Accept(visitor)
        visitor.Visit[Package|Class|Feature](B)
            visitor.VisitInbound(B.Inbound())
                A.AcceptInbound(visitor)
                    visitor.VisitInbound[Package|Class|Feature]Node(A)

If you are only interested in outbound dependencies, you only have to
implement =VisitOutbound[Package|Class|Feature]Node()= and leave their inbound
equivalents empty.  If you are only interested in inbound dependencies, you
only have to implement =VisitInbound[Package|Class|Feature]Node()= and leave
their outbound equivalents empty.

There is a =VisitorBase= class that embodies the Template pattern.  It
implements all the methods from the =Visitor= interface, provides default
traversal of the dependency graph, and offers numerous extension points where
specific visitors can insert their own custom behavior.  The following class
diagram shows all the methods that make up the extension points.

    [[images/DependencyVisitorBaseTemplatePatterns.gif]]
*Template Patterns in =VisitorBase=*
</div>

Let's look into more details at =visitPackageNode()= to get a better
understanding of how the various templates operate.

<div class="highlight">

    01:    public void visitPackageNode(PackageNode node) {
    02:        boolean inScope = *isInScope*(node);
    03:
    04:        if (inScope) {
    05:            *preprocessPackageNode*(node);
    06:
    07:            if (getStrategy().doPreOutboundTraversal()) {
    08:                traverseOutbound(node.getOutboundDependencies());
    09:            }
    10:
    11:            if (getStrategy().doPreInboundTraversal()) {
    12:                traverseInbound(node.getInboundDependencies());
    13:            }
    14:
    15:            *preprocessAfterDependenciesPackageNode*(node);
    16:        }
    17:
    18:        traverseNodes(node.getClasses());
    19:
    20:        if (inScope) {
    21:            *postprocessBeforeDependenciesPackageNode*(node);
    22:
    23:            if (getStrategy().doPostOutboundTraversal()) {
    24:                traverseOutbound(node.getOutboundDependencies());
    25:            }
    26:
    27:            if (getStrategy().doPostInboundTraversal()) {
    28:                traverseInbound(node.getInboundDependencies());
    29:            }
    30:
    31:            *postprocessPackageNode*(node);
    32:        }
    33:    }

</div>

Line 2 determines if we should bother visiting this package _node_ at all.  But
before that comes into play, notice that on line 18, we traverse the classes in
the package unconditionally.  _inScope_ will only affect whether or not we look
at the node itself and its dependencies; it has no bearings on classe in the
package or their features.  The =isInScope()= method is an extension point for
this template method.

A subclass can do some processing before going down to visit classes.  This is
shown in lines 4 through 16.  =preprocessPackageNode()= on line 5, is called
before any dependencies or classes have been visited.
=preprocessAfterDependenciesPackageNode()=, on line 15, is called after the
dependencies but before the classes.  They represent two more extension points
for this template method.

Similarily, a subclass can do some processing after going down to visit the
classes.  This is shown in lines 20 through 32.
=postprocessBeforeDependenciesPackageNode()= on line 21, is called before any
dependencies but after the classes have been visited.
=postprocessPackageNode()=, on line 31, is called after the dependencies and
the classes.  They represent two more extension points for this template
method.

The =TraversalStrategy= instance decides if inbound or outbound dependencies
get visited.  The methods =traverseNodes()=, =traverseOutbound()=, and
=traverseInbound()= provide the traversal of the graph.  They are the common
behavior of the template method.

The template methods =visitClassNode()= and =visitFeatureNode()= work very much
the same way, except that =FeatureNode=s have no descendants.

When overriding any of the extension methods, such as =preprocessPackageNode()=
and =postprocessPackageNode()=, it is very important to call their =super=
definitions.

<div class="lowlight">

    protected void preprocessPackageNode(PackageNode node) {
        super.preprocessPackageNode(node);
        /%2A Custom processing ... %2A/
    }

    /%2A ... %2A/

    protected void postprocessPackageNode(PackageNode node) {
        /%2A Custom processing ... %2A/
        super.postprocessPackageNode(node);
    }

</div>

This lets =VisitorBase= maintain a stack of =Nodes= that represents the current
path through the graph.  All subclasses can call =getCurrentNode()= to get at
the current node in the traversal.  This is particuliarily handy in the methods
that process inbound and outbound nodes to let them know which perspective to
use when looking at a dependency.  For a dependency =A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B=, are
we visiting =A= and looking at an outbound dependency to =B=?  Or are we
visiting =B= and looking at an inbound dependency from =A=?  Some visitors care
about this distinction, like =TextPrinter= for example.

---++++ =Visitor= and =TraversalStrategy=

Here is an example showing the sequence of calls betweeen a visitor
implementation based on =VisitorBase=, its =TraversalStrategy=, and a sample
dependency graph.  You can find the graph in
[[SampleGraph.xml][SampleGraph.xml]].

Here is the sample graph, magnified so you can see what is going on.  The focus
will be placed on package =P1=, class =C1=, and feature =f1=.  Even-numbered
elements have dependencies on them and they have dependencies on odd-numbered
elements.  This example illustrates the traversal order and processing that
occurs on child nodes, outbound dependencies, and inbound dependencies.

<div align="center">
    [[images/DependencyVisitorLegend.gif]]
*Sample Dependency Graph*
</div>

For the sake of this example, we use a plain =SelectiveTraversalStrategy=.  It
will dictate the traversal of a node's outbound and inbound dependencies before
the traversal moves on to the subnodes.  We will decorate it with a
=SortedTraversalStrategy= that will sort groups of nodes in alphabetical
order.

    visitor = new SomeVisitor(new SortedTraversalStrategy(new SelectiveTraversalStrategy()))
    visitor.TraverseNodes({P2, P1, P3})
    strategy.Order({P2, P1, P3})   %3D%3D>  {P1, P2, P3}

---++ OO Metrics

You use =com.jeantessier.metrics.MetricsGatherer= instance to read class
files and compute the metrics.  It is a
=com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor= and will traverse the complete
structure rooted at the =Classfile= instance and compute various metrics.

The =MetricsGatherer= uses a =MetricsFactory= to create the various =Metrics=
instances.  The factory uses a =MetricsConfiguration= instance to decide what
measurements make up a given set of metrics.  The configuration is loaded at
runtime from an XML file.

By default, the value of each measurement is computed only the first time
it is requested and then cached for further request.  You can refresh the
caches through the API and you can turn off caching of individual
measurements through their descriptor and in the configuration file.

---+++ Data Structure

<div align="center">
    [[images/MetricsLegend.gif]]
    [[images/MetricsStructure.gif]]
</div>

----

---++ API Differences

You can use =com.jeantessier.classreader.ClassfileLoader= classes to
examine the baseline of your codebase; be they in JAR files, loose
class files, or a combination of both.  You can apply the same treatment
to your latest codebase.  You now have two sets =Classfile= instances.

You can use =com.jeantessier.dependency.NodeFactory= to create a tree
of packages, classes, and features from each codebase.  You can then
start to compare them to each other.  If a package is in the old
codebase but not in the new one, you can mark it as having been removed.
If it is not in the old codebase but it is in new one, then you can
mark it as having been recently added.  For packages that are present
in both codebase, you can repeat this analysis at the class level, and
then at the feature level.

----

---++ Command-Line Parsing

The =com.jeantessier.commandline= package gives you the tools you need to parse
the command-line to your program, validate switches and parameters, and even
print a summary usage statement when your program is not called properly.
_Switches_ start with a dash ("=-=") and usually have specific semantics
attached to them.  _Parameters_ are just strung out on the command-line and
usually don't have individual specific semantics, besides those they share as a
group.

You create a =CommandLine= instance to parse your command-line.  At creation
time, you can supply a specifc =ParameterStrategy=.  Here are a the ones that
ship with Dependency Finder.

<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt>=AnyParameterStrategy=</dt>
    <dd>No restrictions, the command-line can include any number of parameters,
    including none at all.  This is the default strategy if you do not specify
    one.</dd>
    <dt>=AtLeastParameterStrategy=</dt>
    <dd>The command-line must include at least a certain number of parameters
    or the framework will find the command-line invalid.</dd>
    <dt>=AtMostParameterStrategy=</dt>
    <dd>The command-line can include at most a certain number of parameters or
    the framework will find the command-line invalid.</dd>
    <dt>=ExactlyParameterStrategy=</dt>
    <dd>The command-line must include an exact number of parameters or the
    framework will find the command-line invalid.</dd>
    <dt>=NullParameterStrategy=</dt>
    <dd>The command-line cannot include any parameters or the framework will
    find the command-line invalid.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

Once you have a parser, you can add switch definitions to it.  There are five
types of switches described below.

<blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt>=ToggleSwitch=</dt>
    <dd>The switch be followed by a value.  It acts as a boolean, =false= if
    absent or =true= if present on the command-line.</dd>
    <dt>=SingleValueSwitch=</dt>
    <dd>The switch must be followed by a value.  It can only appear once on the
    command-line.</dd>
    <dt>=OptionalValueSwitch=</dt>
    <dd>The switch can appear by itself or followed by a value.  It can only
    appear once on the command-line.</dd>
    <dt>=MultipleValuesSwitch=</dt>
    <dd>The switch must be followed by a value, but it can occur multiple times
    on the command-line.  The values are accumulated in the same order as on
    the command-line and you retrieve them as a single =List=.</dd>
    <dt>=AliasSwitch=</dt>
    <dd>An alias swich passes its values to the switches it is an alias for.
    You can use an alias switch to group many switches together so you can set
    them all at once with just one name.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

You add switches with the matching =addSwitch()= methods on =CommandLine=.  You
can supply switches with default values and specify if they are mandatory (must
appear on the command-line) or not.

When you create the parser, you can also specify if the parser will be _strict_
or not.  Strict parsers will only accept switches that are explicitly specified.
Non-strict parsers treat an unknown switch as an =OptionalValueSwitch=.

Along with your =CommandLine= parser, you can create a =CommandLineUsage= that
will create a summary description of your command-line specification.  You can
use this summary in error messages for invalid command-lines to help users
figure out what they did wrong.

To actually parse your command-line, just call =CommandLine='s =parse()= method
and pass it the string array that is =main()='s sole parameter.  The parser
will throw an exception if anything went wrong.  After parsing, you can check
for the presence of specific switches with the =IsPresent()= method and get
the value(s) of specific switches with one of the =Switch()= methods.  You can
retrieve parameters, if any, with the =Parameters()= method.

---++ Building Dependency Finder

Before you can compile Dependency Finder, you need to set the following
environment variables:

    * =CATALINA_HOME= to your [[http://tomcat.apache.org/][Tomcat]] installation
    * =WEBWORK_HOME= to your [[http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/][WebWork]] installation

---+++ Building an Executable

This target will create everything you need to run Dependency Finder in-place.

    =ant exec=

If you make a change and you simply want to refresh the executable, simply run:

    =and jar=

---+++ Building the Documentation

This target will create both Javadocs and the various manuals.

    =ant docs=

---+++ Compiling a Build

This target will create a set of distribution files from a clean build.

    =ant=

---+++ Testing the Build

Before you can compile and run the tests, you need to set the following
environment variables in addition to those for compiling Dependency Finder:

    * =JUNIT_HOME= to your [[http://junit.org/][JUnit]] installation
    * =JMOCK_HOME= to your [[http://jmock.org/][jMock]] installation
    * =FITLIBRARY_HOME= to your [[http://fitlibrary.sourceforge.net/][FitLibrary]] installation
    * =HTTPUNIT_HOME= to your [[http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/][HttpUnit]] installation

You will also need to put =junit.jar= on Ant's =CLASSPATH=.  For this, you can
either set the =CLASSPATH= environment variable, or with Ant 1.6 and above, you
can copy =junit.jar= to =${user.home}/.ant/lib=, where =${user.home}= is the
home directory for the current user.  This depends on your operating system.
On Unix, it is =$HOME= and is typically =/home/_username_=.  On Windows, it is
typically =C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\_username_=.

I recommend you use JUnit 4.4 or later, where the JAR file is named
=junit-X.Y.jar=, but everything should work as is with any version of JUnit 3.8
and above (where the JAR file was named =junit.jar=), and even some older ones.

To run all tests and generate test reports in the =reports= directory:

    1 =set CLASSPATH%3D%JUNIT_HOME%\junit-4.4.jar=
    1 =ant -f build.test.xml=

or, to run tests manually:

    1 =set CLASSPATH%3D%JUNIT_HOME%\junit-4.4.jar=
    1 =ant -f build.test.xml compile=
    1 =textjunit TestAll=
    1 =textjunit com.jeantessier.fitlibrary.TestAll=

---+++ Making a Release

These instructions make sure you are working from a clean copy of the =master=
branch of the repository that has been tagged appropriately.

    1 =git tag -m "Tagging the <VERSION /> release of Dependency Finder" <VERSION />=
    1 =git push --tags=
