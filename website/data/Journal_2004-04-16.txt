Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Xerces</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.5.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>_none_</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Xalan</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.5.1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.6.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I am not going to chase after Xerces anymore.  I do not use anything
fancy that would require me to be absolutely up-to-date.  I will do
just as fine with the version that comes with Xalan.  And thie way, I
don't have to worry about my Xerces version working with my Xalan
version.
