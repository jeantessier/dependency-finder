Refactored =CodeDependencyCollector.visitClassfile()= so it calls
=super.visitClassfile(classfile)= to traverse the parts of the =Classfile=
instead of doing it explicitly.  This means that it will now visit the
attributes of the =Classfile= in addition to its fields and methods.  For now,
=CodeDependencyFinder= ignores the attributes that can be attached to a file,
but I'm tempted to collect dependencies from attributes such as:

    * =EnclosingMethod_attribute=
    * =InnerClasses_attribute=
    * =Signature_attribute=

=EnclosingMethod_attribute= is particularily interesting because it would be
the first time we have an explicit dependency going from a class to a feature.

I also noticed that =com.jeantessier.metrics.MetricsGatherer= only looks for a
class' =Synthetic%5Fattribute= and does not look at the class' =ACCESS%5FFLAG=.  I
need to fix this so it calls =Classfile.isSynthetic()= instead.  The same
probably goes for other visitors and for other properties of things with
attributes.

I have been doing a lot of thinking about large projects that run out of memory
to hold the dependency graph.  In one case, I have a very large JAR file with
all the project classes in it and even if I give =DependencyExtractor= over
1.5GB of memory, it still runs out.  I could add scoping to the extractor, but
this feels like piling too many responsabilities on one tool, espcially when it
is already the purview of =DependencyReporter=.  I could partition the graph
across many machines.  I can already merge graphs, so the client could ask all
partitions (in parallel) and merge the results together.  But now I'm facing
the problem of how to partition the graph and how to prevent parsing the
=.class= files multiple times.  I am exploring the possibility of having
lightweight implementations of =Classfile= and its constituents to help with
deciding how to partition the graph, and how this plays with the notions of
_group_ and _file_ in a loading session.
