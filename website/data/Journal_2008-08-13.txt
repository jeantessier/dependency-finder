Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>7.0.3</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>8.0 Milestone 1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Added tests to =CodeDependencyCollector= to capture that exception handling
generates a feature-to-class dependency.

For a moment, I had the crazy idea that I could use raw class-to-class
dependencies instead of storing inheritance information seperately in the
dependency graph.  By _inheritance_, I mean both generalization (=extends=) and
realization (=implements=).  But that is not going to work because there could
be other reasons besides inheritance to have class-to-class dependencies, such
as collapsing the graph with =DependencyReporter -c2c=.
