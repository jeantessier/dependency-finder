Used an =Enum= for the actions in =ClassfileLoaderDispatcher= so test error
messages would be more significative.  Previously, they were integers. 

Downgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>FitLibrary</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>20070217</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>20060116</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
