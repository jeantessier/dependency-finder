Dependency Finder is now four years old.

It turns out the problem with re-extracting graphs had to do with
=CodeDependencyCollector= not setting _concreteness_
correctly.  That would throw off =DeletingVistor= when
rolling back a class during re-extraction.  One problem fixed.

Now, I need to get the GUI to use the new =Monitor=
too.
