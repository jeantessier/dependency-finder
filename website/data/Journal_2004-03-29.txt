Removed all support for serialization of the dependency graph.  I
was never able to deserialize the graphs anyway.  I was semi-useful for
guesstimating the size of the graph, but =DependencyMetrics=
is much better for that.  Serialiazed objects are not forward-
compatible anyway, so they do not make a good mechanism for
persistence.

I started to compress the sample XML files on the project's home
page.  They were taking up too much space and making me overrun my
quota over there.
