Finished separating the classes that make up =Classfile= into interfaces and
a implementation classes in a sub-package.

Next, I want to break the visitor hierarchy in =com.jeantessier.dependency= to
use compisition instead of inheritance for separating graph traversal from the
specific functions.  A wrapper will take care of traversal and delegate to
another visitor for the work to do.  This way, I will be able to test traversal
logic with jMock instead of relying on a subclass.
