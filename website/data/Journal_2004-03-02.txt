Scott Stirling pointed out IBM's SA4J to me.  Apparently, IBM
acquired SmallWorlds and this is based on the SmallWorlds tool.  It
would explain why my link to SmallWorlds on the Resource page is
broken.  Thanks Scott for pluging Dependency Finder in a related
article on
[[http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.jsp?thread_id=24255][TheServerSide.COM]].

Scott also gave me some feedback on the documentation and submitted
some improvements.  He's also investigating graphical rendering of
graphs on his own.  I'll keep you posted.
