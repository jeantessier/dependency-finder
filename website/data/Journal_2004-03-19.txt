Looked at the bug list and feature request list.  It had been a while.  There
was one bug request regarding broken links on the web site, and two requests
for interesting new ways to use JarJarDiff.

It turns out that I had thought of one such way back on [[2003-08-19]].  The
idea is to use a dependency graph to list the parts of a third party API you
are using.  Then feed this list to JarJarDiff to limit the hange report to the
subset that you are really using.  All the tools are there, it's just a matter
of how you use them.  I scanned my notes and added them to
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D900446&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435887x][feature request #900446]]
until I come up with a formal description.
