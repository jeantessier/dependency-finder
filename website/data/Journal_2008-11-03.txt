Removed =ConstantPool= from the public interface of =*Annotations_attribute=
components.  The fact that some of them hold on to the constant pool and do
lookup at runtime is an implementation detail.

Fixed =Parameter= so it actually reads its annotations from the byte stream.  I
also simplified its interface to remove the back reference to
=RuntimeParameterAnnotations_attribute=.

Added =getAttributeName()= to all attributes.  I had to simplify some of the
constructors that were echoing the data as they read it in order to keep the
tests simple.

    * =ConstantValue_attribute=
    * =EnclosingMethod_attribute=
    * =Signature_attribute=
    * =SourceFile_attribute=

But after trying it out on some sample code, I realized that it
hampers usability, so I will have to put them back in.  I also removed
dependence on the behavior of =toString()= in a few places.

Addded =AnnotationDefault_attribute=.
