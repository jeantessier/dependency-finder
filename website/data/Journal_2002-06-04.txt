Added =SumMeasurement= in preparation for SLOC
and dependency measurements.

Created =metrics.dtd= and put it at:

    [[dtd][http://depfind.sourceforge.net/dtd/]]

Fixed a mistyped measurement in =MetricsConfig.xml=.

Fixed =MeasurementBase.InRange()= to handle
textual thresholds.  It assumed the thresholds were instances
of =Number=, but the XML descriptor provides them
as text which has to be parsed.
