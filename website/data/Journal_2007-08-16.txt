A short while ago, someone filed a bug against =JarJarDiff= because it doesn't
encode special characters in its XML output, like '&lt;' embeded in string values.
I got a case of that today as I was comparing two versions of a library and one
of the strings contained a non-ASCII character that was not getting escaped.

I started by writing a test against =com.jeantessier.classreader.XMLPrinter=
and the '&gt;' character, only to find out that this one XML generator actually
escape certain characters already.  But it's the only one to do so and it only
handles '&lt;', '&gt;', and '&amp;'.

The person who filed the bug proposed using an =XMLUtil= class copied from some
other open source software.  I'm not a big fan of utility classes so we'll see
how it all turns out.  Because of the way the printer hierarchy is organized,
I might have to duplicate the escaping code between them if I don't want to use
a utility class.
