Got rid of the =Validator= hierarchy.  The only one that
was used at all was =ListBasedValidator= which I turned into
a decorator for =DiffereneStrategy=.  The resulting design
is much cleaner and it makes =DifferencesFactory= that much
simpler.  One last strategy for backward-compatibility-breaking changes
and I'll be done with this development item.
