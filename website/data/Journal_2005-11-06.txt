Fixed interaction between =DifferencesStrategy= and its
=DifferenceStrategy= so we can overlook class differences
when the stategy dictates that we do.  This is to support the case when
a class has a backwards compatible change to its declaration but some
of its features have non-backwards compatible changes.  I still want to
report the feature changes, but I want to ignore the class declaration
difference.
