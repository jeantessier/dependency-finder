It turns out the problem with closures comes down to Windows batch files strip
'^' characters from parameters.  So if you want to filter out =java.*= with a
regular espression =/^java/=, the Java program only gets =/java/= and filters
everything with "java" anywhere in it.  I filed a
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1592817&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][bug report (1592817)]] for it.

For now, the best solution is to enclose regular expressions in double quotes,
such as ="/^java/"=, so the shell and script don't strip anything.  Similarily
under Unix, if you regular expression contains many meta-characters like '\',
'(', or '[', you need to escape them properly.  Maybe there is no fix for it
besides education.  I should add a note on this in the documentation.
