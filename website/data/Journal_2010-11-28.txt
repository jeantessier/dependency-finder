Figured out the problem with the =ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException= on =wide=
instructions.  There are helper methods inside the =Instruction= class to fetch
individual bytes from the bytecode.  They all take offsets from the
instruction's start position in the bytecde.  One branch of a =case= statement
was adding the instruction's start position to the offset before calling the
helper, resulting in a fetch at twice the start position.  If the instruction
was past the half-way park, it resulted in =ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException=.

Found another problem with escaping text in XML documents from =ClassReader=.
It is possible for some string constants in the bytecode to contains characters
that are not strictly UTF-8.  I had to brush up on my XML to fix this one.  I
found a promising library in Commons Lang from the Apache Project, but it did
not handle low value control characters that are below the range of normal
visible characters.  So I had to rework
=com.jeantessier.classreader.XMLPrinter.escapeXMLCharacters()= myself.  I don't
think I'll have the same problem with the other XML generators because they
don't deal with the raw constant strings in Java the way =ClassReader= does.

Released version 1.2.1 beta4.
