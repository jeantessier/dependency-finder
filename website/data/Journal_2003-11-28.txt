Fixed bug #804400.  It dealt with "=start ...=" commands
in both =DependencyFinder.bat= and =OOMetrics.bat=
batch files.  I added a quoted string right after the initial
=start= so the shell interprets the executable name
correctly under all circumstances.

Ant's latest version of their
[[http://ant.apache.org/external.html][list of external tools]]
now includes Dependency Finder.  That was quick!
