Looked into the possibility of estimating SLOC by looking at the minimum and
maximum values in =LineNumberTable_attribute= instances in a given class.  One
problem I have, and this is true for the current SLOC calculation too, is that
fields that are initialized in initialization blocks (including constructors)
are counted twice.  Also, looking at overall mininum line number versus maximum
line number takes into account vertical space as well and comments.
