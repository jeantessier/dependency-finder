<p>Is the head of the hierarchy for all user-interface for Dependency Finder.</p>

<p>The classes in these sub-packages serve two purposes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Presentation layer for the application</li>
    <li>Examples of how to use the libraries that make up Dependency Finder</li>
</ol>

<p>The first purpose is self-explanatory, but the second one deserves extra
attention.  The code in each class is meant to provide a one-stop example of
how you can build tools using Dependency Finder.  As such, I did not try to
refactor common code into helper classes or create complex hierarchies.  There
is a fair bit of duplication and some of the code can be quite unsophisticated.
This is done on purpose so that you can study any which one in isolation and
understand how you can rool up your own.</p>

<h4>Layers</h4>

<p>You can think of {@link com.jeantessier.classreader} as a kind of read-only
persistence, where we obtain data from compiled Java classes on the
filesystem.</p>

<p>The packages {@link com.jeantessier.dependency},
{@link com.jeantessier.diff}, and {@link com.jeantessier.metrics} are where you
will find all the logic for dealing with graphs and various results.</p>

<p>The packages {@link com.jeantessier.commandline} and
{@link com.jeantessier.text} are utility packages.</p>
